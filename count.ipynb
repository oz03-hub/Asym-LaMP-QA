Today, after cooking it, we realized why: there were hundreds of bones in the fish, all waiting to make their way into our throats. We stopped eating it and threw it away. I realized at the same time that even though they were potential hazards, it was such a waste of money.Question is, how do we best efficiently filter out fish bones from fish that have tons of them? In other words, is there an easier way besides manually pulling out the bones one by one?\n",

      "Second Output: Based on your interest in efficient methods for tasks like deboning fish, ensuring even distribution of ingredients, and fixing kitchen faucets, I can suggest a few tips for efficiently farming iron nuggets. First, consider using a tool like a pickaxe with a high mining speed enchantment to quickly gather iron ore. Additionally, setting up an automated system with a hopper and a furnace can help you process the iron ore into iron nuggets more efficiently. This way, you can focus on other tasks while the system works for you. Also, don't forget to check for any updates or mods that might offer even more efficient mining methods.\n",
