# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Is Boogiepop series connected to the Boogie music genre? Looking up the Oxford dictionary, the definition of "boogie" is:  A style of blues played on the piano with a strong, fast beat.From Wikipedia it is defined as:  Boogie (sometimes called post-disco) is a rhythm and blues genre of electronic dance music with close ties to the post-disco styleAs I am unfamiliar with the genre, I tried a few sample of boogie music. I don't really see it matches the atmosphere of the anime (neither the 2000 nor 2019 adaptation). Boogiepop himself "seems fond of whistling the prelude to Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" which is also not related to boogie genre.Also I don't see it too related to pop genre either.

Boogiepop and Others Promotional Trailer references 2019's "Boogiepop and Others" TV series has a promotional trailer. However the trailer is kind of "fake", because many footage are not present in the actual TV show.The main ones are:On Opera stageA man fighting a fire ability userBoogiepop walking closer to another girl, and the background switches with each swing from BoogiepopAre these referencing other unadapted stories in the series? If yes, which are those?

Meaning of telegraph code in the song "Planetes" The song Planetes in Guilty Crown begins with some telegraph encoding, which I think is Wabun code.Here is the YouTube link.My transcription is:-•-• -••-- •-- --•-- •- --•-• •-•-- -•--•which decodes to this:ni-yu-ya a-i-shi-te-ruNiyuya didn't make sense. Did I get something wrong?

In Master Keaton, is TV news being used as secret code based on real world practice? Vol.8 of Master Keaton starts with the TV broadcasting a news segment about 'a Lion was accidentally trapped inside the cage of leopards in some zoo near River Seine.' This was later explained that it symbolizes a royal family member being in danger overseas, and is used by the British government to secretly notify the related parties (agents?)Was this based on some real world practice?

Does Fez require controller which can vibrate? There are some FEZ puzzles which I can't solve. That led me to think that, maybe those require a controller which can provide vibration feedback (I am currently playing with keyboard). Is my guess correct?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
What happened to Hibiya and Hiyori after they broke out of the time loop? (It's been over four years since I watched Mekaku City Actors and it wasn't the most coherent anime, so please forgive me if I've gotten any details wrong or missed something obvious.)In the episode "Heat Haze Daze", Hibiya and Hiyori are trapped in an infinite time loop in which Hiyori keeps dying, and Hibiya keeps trying and failing to save her. They finally break out of the time loop (I presume) when   Hibiya sacrifices himself to save Hiyori's life.The next time we see them is when Haruka breaks open the back of a van to find them bound and gagged inside. I don't recall there ever being an explanation of how they got there.What happened to Hibiya and Hiyori between them breaking out of the time loop and Haruka finding them in the van? Who put them there, and why?

Why didn't Roberta kill these characters? In Part 4 of Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail, Shenhua attacks Roberta and is swiftly backed up by Sawyer and Rotton. Roberta breaks Sawyer's chainsaw and one of Shenhua's kukris, has the two held at gunpoint... then just kicks Rotton in the balls and walks away, sparing all three of them.I haven't watched Part 5 yet, but so far this is the only time Roberta has shown mercy in the entire OVA. Later on in Part 4, she reacts to Eda helping her by promising to kill her painlessly, yet here she spares three random strangers who were trying to kill her, two-thirds of whom were still armed in some capacity. I don't understand why.It could be that Roberta's just trying to catch up to the American soldiers and/or Garcia, and doesn't want to waste time killing them, but she doesn't seem to be in that much of a hurry - as I noted, she walks away from the incident in question. It could also just be that she's gone completely insane at this point, and trying to analyse her actions is a waste of time. But I'd like to try anyway.Why didn't Roberta kill Shenhua, Sawyer, and Rotton?To repeat: I haven't seen Part 5 yet, so I don't want to Google anything in case I stumble across any spoilers. If the answer is "watch Part 5", so be it.

Why wasn't this character killed immediately? In Persona 5, after you   steal Okumura's Treasure, his Shadow is killed by an unseen assassin. This happens in the very same cutscene, literally two seconds after the Phantom Thieves have left the room.By my understanding, this should have resulted in    an immediate mental shutdown.And yet nothing happens until   the press conference on October 12th. Depending on how long it took you to clear the Palace, that's up to three weeks later.Now, I understand that the out-of-universe reason for this is that if   Okumura had died the moment you cleared the Palaceit would have completely messed up the game's timeline of events. But in-universe, it doesn't make sense, especially considering that   the villains were relying on Okumura dying at exactly that moment, in order to implicate the Phantom Thieves in his death.How should this be reconciled? In-universe, why didn't this character die immediately?

How to trick the reader into thinking they're following a redshirt instead of the protagonist? I'm currently planning a "magical girl" story, and I thought of an interesting way to start it, rather than launching straight into the backstory. It opens with a woman in her mid-thirties, complete with ponytail of death, walking through a city market while being stalked by a shadowy monster.What I want readers to expect is that the woman is either going to be killed by the monster, or saved from it in the nick of time by the heroine. What actually happens is that when the monster finally attacks, the woman transforms into a magical girl, beats the everloving crap out of the monster, and then destroys it with a magical laser beam. Surprise! She is the heroine.I want to try and preserve this surprise as best I can, and make the readers think they're following a redshirt or one-off character instead of the protagonist. Not referring to her by name until after the reveal will help, but it's probably not enough. What else can I do to achieve this?(I'm aware of answers on other questions to the effect of "don't trick your readers". In my case, this is supposed to be a pleasant surprise, so I feel like it's okay.)

Did Amara know what she was saying to Viktoria? Early on in Pacific Rim: Uprising, after Amara first clashes with Viktoriya, one of the other cadets offers to teach Amara a few words of Russian "to help you get along with her", or something to that effect. Later on in the film, when they get into another argument, the following exchange occurs:  Amara: [in Russian] Kiss my ass.  Viktoriya: What did you say?!  Amara: [in Russian] Kiss my ass. [in English, to the other cadet] Am I saying that right?  [Viktoriya attacks her]There are two possible interpretations of this scene:Amara knew exactly what that phrase meant and was deliberately trying to rile Viktoriya up.The other cadet tricked her when he taught her that phrase, and Amara thought she was saying something that would defuse the situation. (This was my initial interpretation of the scene.)Which interpretation is correct? Was Amara knowingly telling Viktoriya to kiss her ass, or was it a misunderstanding?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Who was able to resist more punches from Saitama, Boros or Garou? It's known few characteres can resist punches from Saitama when he's half serious (probably only Boros, Garou and Orochi until now)Who was able to resist more punches from Saitama, Boros or Garou?

Was Suiryu or Garou who defeated Saitama in Virtual Reality? In OVA #4 season 2, Saitama is defeating playing Virtual Reality and Genos says the one who defeated might be able to defeat Saitama in real life. Then we see those moving to the finals of the competition are Suiryu and Garou.Was Suiryu or Garou who defeated Saitama in Virtual Reality?

Why Saitama was so poorly promoted after he defeated this insanely powerful enemy? So, in the battle between the Hero Association and the Monster Association,   Saitama defeated Garou.Why was he only promoted to Class A? 

Is Garou actually evil? So, Garou apparently doesn't kill his opponents.Later in the manga, he   saves a kid from monsters.And in the webcomic, Saitama says what Garou actually wanted to be is    a hero.Is Garou actually supposed to be evil?

Can Black Sperm return to be as powerful as he was? After the battle with Garou in the webcomic,   Black Sperm becomes Saitama's pet in a weakened stateCan he regrow his cells and become as powerful as he was, or all the cells he lost can't be recovered?
# Current post question:
Was Saitama sweating with worry when he saw Garou in this scene?

{  "personalized_answer": "It sounds like your equipment is breaking due to a combination of factors, including potential issues with pressure relief, improper setup, and possibly even accidental damage. From your past questions, it seems you're dealing with a variety of problems, from plumbing to electrical systems and even gaming equipment. Here are a few steps to consider for your current issue with equipment breaking:\n\n1. **Pressure Relief**: For your plumbing issue, you might need to install a pressure relief valve to prevent water pressure from building up and causing damage. This can help prevent the shower from getting cold when someone flushes a toilet.\n\n2. **Proper Setup**: Ensure that all your equipment, especially those with GFCI protection, are properly set up and maintained. For instance, if you suspect the GFCI is causing issues with your ceiling fan, you might need to check the wiring and ensure the GFCI is not tripping unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Replacement Parts**: When dealing with broken parts like the PVC ball valve, you might need to replace the valve itself rather than trying to fix the handle. This can be done by cutting the pipes and installing a new valve, but make sure to relieve the pressure first to avoid flooding.\n\n4. **Gaming Squad Issues**: If you're experiencing issues with public squads being "locked," you might need to ensure that both you and your friend are on the same server or that the squad settings are correctly configured. Sometimes, joining the squad in a specific order or ensuring the correct permissions are set can resolve these issues.\n\n5. **Xbox 360 DVD Drive**: For your Xbox 360, it's crucial to ensure that the replacement DVD drive is compatible with your specific model. You might need to consult the original documentation or seek professional help to ensure the correct model and firmware are used. If the issue persists, consider taking it to a repair shop for a more thorough diagnosis and repair."}

{  "personalized_answer": "Based on your previous interest in the formatting of Hebrew texts, it seems you are particularly interested in understanding the various elements used in Hebrew/Aramaic texts on Sefaria. These formatting styles serve different purposes and can be quite informative. Here's a breakdown of what you might see and their meanings:\n\n1. **Quotes (' and "")**: These are used to denote direct speech or quotations within the text. They help distinguish between the original text and any quoted material.\n\n2. **Parentheses (small and large)**: Small parentheses are often used to include additional information or references, while large parentheses are used for more significant notes or explanations. For example, <small>(תהלים ק\"ד, כ\"ד)</small> indicates a reference to a specific verse in the Psalms.\n\n3. **Bold Text**: Bold text is typically used to highlight names, important phrases, or key terms. In the example you provided, <big><strong>ר' אהרן</strong></big> and <big><strong>ר' אשר</strong></big> are likely names of important figures.\n\n4. **Italics**: Italics are used to emphasize certain words or phrases, often to draw attention to them or to indicate a specific meaning or context.\n\n5. **Brackets and Parentheses**: These are used to include additional information, corrections, or explanations. For example, [כָּל חָכְמָה מֵיהֹוָה, וִעמּוֹ הִיא לְעוֹלָמִים.] indicates a bracketed addition or clarification.\n\n6. **Hyphens**: Hyphens are used to connect words, such as in compound words or to indicate a break in a word that continues on the next line.\n\n7. **Page Numbers and Whitespace**: These are used to organize the text and make it easier to navigate. The whitespace spans you mentioned are typically used to separate different sections or paragraphs, making the text more readable.\n\n8. **Font Styles**: The font styles you mentioned, such as ShlomoStam, are designed to closely resemble traditional Torah scroll scripts. They are used to ensure the text remains authentic and easily readable for those familiar with the traditional format.\n\n9. **Paragraphs and Sections**: Paragraphs and sections are often indicated by changes in indentation or whitespace, making it easier to distinguish between different parts of the text.\n\n10. **Verse and Chapter Numbers**: These are usually placed at the beginning of each verse or chapter, often in a smaller font size, to help readers quickly locate specific passages.\n\nUnderstanding these formatting styles will help you better appreciate the text and make it more accessible for study and reading. If you have any specific questions about the formatting or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"}

To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Is giving child ride considered spoiling? My sister lives 15-20min walk from her school but my mom gives her a ride in the car every morning.  Is this considered spoiling the child or no.  In my opinion it is because I think it's a perfectly close enough distance to walk.

Is investing all your savings into a small number of individual stocks risky? I want to invest 90% of my savings into stock market and split between 4-6 stocks.  How risky is this and is it a bad idea.  I feel like the stock market goes up over time so unless something like 2008 depression happens again there is actually not that much risk?Note that I'm trying to turn this into a form of income and not simply getting decent returns for retirement etc.  I am okay with reasonable risk so I can work less hopefully.

bread made with egg safe to leave outside? I have some bread that has egg in it.  Safe to leave the bread at room temp after baking?  Im asking because I wouldn't leave scrambled eggs at room temp but is bread ok?

What causes a stock to make an EXTREMELY big move in a short period? Today (8/19/20) I was paper trading a stock REDU.  I was in a short position without a stop loss and stock went from 6.74 to 7.48 or over 10% in a span of less than 30 seconds, faster than I could react to get out.  Is this due to low trade volume and the bid and ask became so wide?  or someone manipulating the market?My question is how can I avoid this scenario in the future.  Would a stop loss work to get me out? or avoid these types of stocks in general.

Is there any reason to not buy if mortgage is comparable to rent? I'm curious: Say if you could buy a property or choose to rent and the mortgage per month on the property is similar to (or even lower) than the rent in your area, is there any reason to not buy?Assuming you are not looking to move and stay in the area long term.Also a follow up question, if you paid half the mortgage somewhere and want to leave, is it easy to transfer the mortgage to someone else and get what you paid so far back?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
First time repairing a rear wheel hub, I am hearing bearing on bearing rattle/clicks when spinning For the sake of doing a restoration I just serviced a rear wheel: new bearings, new grease, new axle and new dust caps.I think I have put enough grease. When spinning the wheel before putting it on the bike I was feeling a bit of crunchiness but no noise. After putting the wheel on, truing it, setting the brakes, I did a spin test: there is no resistance, the wheel does spin for a while with a single push. Unfortunately there is a significant metal on metal noise, feels like a bearing on bearing friction. The wheel has also a tiny bit of play but it is attached safety to the bike.Here is a video with audio: https://imgur.com/a/BTmexIYAlso, I had to replace the dust caps by a wee bit smaller ones (25mm vs 28mm), but I do not think this is to blame.

New DIY project: restoring this bike from the bins. How can I service this back wheel? I picked a broken bike from the garbage around the block. The bike has some damage. It looks like a stolen bike (spray paint awfully over original color), so it must have had some tough love. I have identified the brand and model from its parts but no one has reported it stolen, yet. It will turn into a restoration job soon.I am not the sharpest bike wrench so I could use some advice. Most parts are in good state. Obviously it needs new brake pads and new tires, and most probably a new chain, as this one is full or rust. The rear derailleur was so bent into the spokes that it broke. Definitely needs replacement by a new one.The work that needs to be done on the rear wheel is not clear to me. The spokes are unbroken but it needs truing. I found it with some of its bearings opened, the ones on the non-driving side. When looking inside: not much contamination but some of the balls seem to be missing. I already have grease. Can I just buy any balls bearings? How do I know how many I need? Also the lock ring on these bearings is crooked? See pictures. Will it close? Or do I need a new one? Is it needed to buy a new axle + bearings? Is it simpler?Here are some pictures https://imgur.com/a/UbB8NrlMany thanks.

How/where can I find replacements for these 'wheel bearing caps'? I have started the restoration of a bike picked up from the bins. The bike has taken some abuse. The rear wheel axle was broken, same for the two "bearings" caps or dust seals. I am not sure how to name these. I am providing pictures here for illustration https://imgur.com/a/fKflsyxIt was really to get a replacement for the bearings and the axle, but that cap piece - maybe because of not knowing its name - I am not able to see it for sale anywhere. I am not sure how standard or custom these pieces are. The hub has no brand or logo. The bike is a carrera zelos if this helps.

What type of bottom bracket is this (pictures)? What tools do I need to replace it? This bike has a lot of play on the bottom bracket. Here are pictures:What replacement can I buy for it? It looks like a square tapper BB to me, how do I measure which size I need? I do not have the tools to open it and read on the piece at this stage. Hence, what tools do I need to replace it?

Cannot fit in the new rain shower head I just bought a shower head from Amazon (Chinese seller I think). As soon as I received it I removed the old one and tried fitting it in. But it cannot be screwed in. The diameter seem identical to the old one with my bare eyes. But the old one screws in easily and this one stops after one turn. I tried cleaning the threads with a toothpick, adding some WD40 and it does not get any easier. Do I need a connector? How universal are the connector widths?I have added pictures.ps: It is not easy to force as the disk part can spin 360 degrees around the connector, hence I have preferred not to force for now.Link to the item I purchased if it helps: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07SSZ9RH7/

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How to care for bent avocado tree I have an avocado tree I started from a pit. It has lived in upstate New York indoors and has grown tall and skinny. I recently moved to Atlanta, Georgia and so can have it outdoors more. The tree is somewhat crooked. Should I prune it? (Possibly even cutting off the top half of the tree?)Should I get a bigger pot?Should I get some kind of system going to stabilize and/or straighten it out? Should I keep it outside all of the time?

Trees for southern Idaho/northern Utah mountain environment My goal is to find trees that would survive in the fairly harsh climate of the mountains of northern Utah/southern Idaho (near Bear Lake). Being in the mountains, it is around 7,000 feet. The trees need to be able to withstand cold temperatures of roughly -20 degrees Fahrenheit as well as be drought resistant. However, we can water them once or twice per week in the summer. What kind of trees meet the bill?We have had some success with aspen trees and some, but less, success with pine trees.

What to do with this Meyer Lemon Tree? I have a Meyer Lemon Tree that used to be doing well, but has lately been losing most of its leaves. See How to tell if indoor lemons are ready to pick for what it used to look like. I had it outside for a while, then brought it inside when it got cold. Since then, it has been not doing well. Around the time of when I brought it in, I harvested two big lemons from it. The first image shows what it looks like. The second is a closeup. There are lots of new buds---are those for lemons or for new leaves?

How to politely tell someone they did not hit "reply to all" in an email? It happens sometimes that somebody (likely) meant to reply all in an email chain, but (likely) accidentally just replied to the last person that sent the email. What is a polite way to inform them of this/ask if they actually intended to reply all?

Is there any chance for this cactus? I have this cactus cactus, but it leans heavily. The bigger it gets, the more it tends to lean. It leaned even before I repotted it, and is even worse after. Is there any saving it, or should I just get rid of it? I live in Georgia and am able to have it outside about half of the year. (I am not equipped to have indoor heat lamps or anything like that.)

[rank0]:[W704 15:31:03.383967941 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How open should I be with my PhD supervisor about the problems in my personal life? My marriage has been going through some problems in the last year which has affected my PhD. My supervisor has been very understanding and was keen for me not to interrupt and granted me a two month extension on my upgrade paper. Last week my wife walked out. She came back but this totally put me off my studies. I was supposed to hand in a paper - an optional paper since this was for a journal submission - but I haven't even drafted it and the draft was due tomorrow.My supervisor knows I have been having marriage problems but she doesn't know any details. Also she doesn't talk about her personal life much and I don't know if she's the kind of person who would be receptive to such details, so I have so far withheld them. Should I tell her my wife walked out? At the moment I have just said there was an incident. She also knows that I have been diagnosed with symptoms of moderate/severe depression, but I thought it best that she knew this since it could affect my work.Should I carry on being vague or should I test the water and treat her like an intelligent adult and give her more context and details of my issues? Or should I just keep the personal stuff as separate as possible?

My PhD seems daunting and overbearing. How shall I regain motivation and interest? EDIT: I should clarify this is not the first draft of my PhD, it's the first draft of my upgrade document to go from MPhil to PhD.I have been working on my PhD for about two years now, it is a six year part-time program. I have a very good relationship with all my supervisors and they are very supportive. I am fortunate to be part of a good university which is open-minded and free-thinking. I also have attracted the interest of a well-known external academic who is an authority within the field and who wants to be involved. I am very lucky.The problem is that I am just not that interested or convinced by my research [chiefly its significance]. I have to submit my upgrade document [MPhil > PhD] in about five week's time, and the viva is a week after that. I have written a draft document which is 12,000 words and my main supervisor has written a lot of comments which are suggestions for improvements. The issue is that I do not feel that interested or compelled to work through them. I am under the impression that my supervisor is not that convinced by my research, even though she keeps saying she has no concerns. I feel my research is too vague, too broad but also too overbearing. It incorporates three disciplines [at the advice of one of my supervisors], disciplines A B and C. Discipline A I am not that interested in - I was for my master's but now I find it quite tedious but it is quite an important part of the whole. It is a well-worn discipline and feels rather old and stale to me now. Discipline B is quite new and interesting, I have published within this discipline. Disipline C is very new and up-and-coming. I find it quite exciting and my supervisor has written the least amount of comments about it in my draft paper, which I take to mean she has the least amount of complaints about it [she has a lot of comments to make about dispclines A/B]. She has also said that discpline C is a 'key' part of the PhD. I do not know what to do. I am really not that interested and the whole thing seems so daunting. My PhD focuses on A and B mostly with C being only a feature, but I am wondering whether I should switch things round entirely and make it more about C. I feel I will not really be able to convince my panel about the significance of my research in the viva if I am not excited about it or convinced myself. In my master's I was always keen to research and write, now I am not, but I know I would be if the topic were carried out a bit differently. What shall I do, how shall I regain interest? My PhD seems rather fluffy and not sharp enough. Additionally, I am daunted by the scope of the whole thing: it seems too large to work through and 'bigger' than me. I am kind of at a loss for what to do.

Should I talk to my supervisor about including a new field in my PhD? I am a part-time PhD student coming towards the end of my first year – I have another five years left. My PhD is in Music and I do like my topic a lot. However, in the last 18 months I have also become very interested in an area that is not that related to music – computing and open source. I started looking at it as something extra to learn before my PhD started and am now finding it difficult to put down. As well as this, I would like to integrate some aspects of what I have learned into my PhD. I just don't really know what and how. Is this something that I should bring up with my PhD supervisor or should I just "put up or shut up"? She may think it's a bit weird to mention it since she will probably feel that it doesn't really relate, however, computing (and its related ethics) are fundamental to the ways in which we undertake academic research these days. We've even had a few classes on software use. I feel that I could probably link the two in some way but little has come up yet which is obvious, though it may well present itself in the future. From past experience I tend to function at my academic best when integrating different challenging interests into my learning and I would love to integrate my learning of computing into my music PhD. I feel I have learned – and applied – a lot and I want to continue learning alongside my music learning and to combine the two in my topic. Question: should I raise this with my supervisor, float some ideas past her about this or should I just ignore it? If I do the latter the question may well come back to haunt me further down the line. I don't think I "can" (nor do I want to) give this up, well, not without forcing myself to since it fascinates me. Do others have experience of wanting to mix in new ideas/subjects into their PhDs and how did you go about it?For clarification - the PhD in Music is ethnomusicological, i.e. the PhD is to do with the study of music in culture and as culture rather than composition or performance.

Is there a preferable time of year when one should apply for a PhD in the UK? [Edited] I am very shortly going to be sending off my PhD application. I cannot apply quite yet because I am waiting on my bachelor's documentation which was withheld (library fines which are now cleared) but now it is in processing, and I do have my transcript. I have my master's documentation. The BA uni say they don't know when the cert will be ready, it could be a week or two, or longer presumably. The deadlines for PhD applications are set as the summer, but I know that many faculties like to have the applications in sooner because they want to decide on their student quantities. Is there some kind of unspoken deadline that I should shoot for in general [e.g. late Feb, Apr etc] or does it vary by institution? Does one lessen one's chances of acceptance if applying nearer to the official early summer deadlines?I should mention that a staff member in my choice of PhD uni has already approved my proposal and agreed to be my supervisor. Should I apply anyway without the BA cert and just say it is in processing [without going into reasons why]? I am not applying for funding.

How long should one wait for a reference before writing to the course convenor? I am getting a little worried about my PhD application. I submitted it three weeks ago with reference requests going out to Prof A and B. Prof B wrote to me the same evening to say it would be done asap, and Prof A didn't respond, but that's fine. Three weeks later and Prof A has written back and completed the reference, though nothing so far from B. I have written to B with a polite reminder but they haven't written back. How long do people take on average to get these things across and should I be concerned? I know these academics are very busy but at the same time this is the only thing holding the application up. Should I write to the convenor about my concern if this goes on for a couple more weeks? What other ways could I politely encourage a response?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Letting students grade their own homework I am going to teach a course in algorithms to 2nd-year undergraduates. The grade in this course is composed of 90% exam and 10% homework. The problem is, this year we do not have enough personnel to grade the homework. Theoretically, it may be possible to change the grade struture and make it 100% based on final exam, but, this will reduce the incentive of students to study and practice during the semester, which I think will harm their learning experience.So, I thought of the following scheme: the students will have to submit each assignment before the next TA session. The TA will explain the solutions during the session, and then each student will grade his/her own homework.Sure, some students might be tempted to give themselves 100 on all assignments, but I believe this will not be very harmful since:All assignments together compose only 10% of the grade, so every single assignment is less than 1%. Even if many students get 10% for free, the final exam is still sufficient to differentiate the good from the bad students. The group consists of excellent students (the top 20%, based on their 1st year mean grade). I believe most of them want to succeed in the exam, so they will take this as an opportunity to track their own progress during the course, rather than an opportunity to just get some points for free.What do you think about this scheme? 

Grades are too high for the department - what should I do? I recently taught an undergraduate seminar course, in which each student has to read a research paper, summarize it and present it to the class. In the first lesson I explained to the students the components of the grade: attendance, summary writing, and presentation quality. Most of the students did great jobs: attendance was near full, summaries were good, and presentations were great. Many of them did more than I expected - they contacted the paper's authors to get more information, presented movies and demos, engaged the class in discussions, etc. So, when I wrote the grades to myself, most of them were between 90 and 100. But then, when I told this to the department vice-chair, he told me "what have you done? You will cause a grade-inflation! The department policy is that the average grade on seminar courses should be at most 85!"I totally understand this policy - grades that are too high might show that the course was too easy, and they do not sufficiently distinguish between good and better students. Also, they might be unfair to students who took the course in previous years.However, I am not sure what I should do now. I haven't published the grades to the students yet. Should I just re-scale the grades so that 90 becomes 70? I feel this is somewhat unfair to the students who worked hard for their presentations. Are there better options?

What to do if most of my students have switched to a better lecturer's class? I teach a certain course which is part of the obligatory undergraduate curriculum. I teach two groups out of four; the other two groups are taught by two other lecturers. In one group I have about 20-30 students. The other group also started with the same number, but students left the group gradually, and now there remain only 5 or even less; the others go to the other lecturer who gives the same lesson in parallel. One reason is probably that I am a new teacher and still not very good at teaching. Another reason is that the other lecturer is very good. I feel that some of the 5 students remaining in my class do so only because they are being polite. I appreciate it very much since I put a lot of effort in preparing the lessons, but it is not very efficient for me or for them. So, I thought of suggesting to the remaining students that they move to the other lecturer's group. This way, they will have a better lecturer and I will have more time for research  (the other lecturer said it's OK with him). What might be the implications of such a step? UPDATE: Thanks a lot for all the feedback. While there are many great answers, the one thing that convinced me to keep going was the fact that this is the only way I can become a better teacher. So today I came to class as usual. For some reason, the number of students rised to 10.

How can I politely decline to guide a student? I am a lecturer in a department in which undergraduate students have to do a final-year project guided (= supervised) by a faculty member. Faculty members do not have to guide students: those who do, get extra payment for this.Most students who want me to be their guide are great and I am happy to guide them, but a few of them - I suspect - will be very "not fun" to work with: when they took a course of mine previously, they argued a lot about their grade, complained a lot about the course rules, etc. They made me spent a lot of time and energy on futile arguments rather than on productive teaching. I do not want to guide these students - I feel it will be a waste of my time and energy, not worth the extra payment.However, if I just tell them bluntly "I do not want to guide you since I do not like you", they will be very insulted.I cannot filter them out based on their grades, since their grades are similar to the average.I could say that "I am too busy to guide you", which is true, but I am not too busy to guide other students, and the student will probably find this out.How can I politely reject their request without insulting them?

Should I prepare new homework exercises each year, 20% of the final grade is homework? This year I prepare a new course (in programming, but it could be any other course). I spend a lot of effort in creating homework exercises. This is fun, but also very time-consuming.I wonder if I can use the same exercises next year, when I teach this course again. The main problem is that, once the solutions are out, surely some students next year will be able to get them and copy them. It may be possible to use some automatic plagiarism detection tools, but it is quite difficult and not very reliable.I believe the copiers will not gain much from copying, since the homework grade is only 20% of the final grade. On the contrary, they will lose since they will be less prepared for the exam, which is 80% of the final grade. My fear is that the temptation to copy will harm these students. So maybe I should create new exercises to avoid the temptation to copy.On the other hand, the students are grown-ups, if they choose to copy, it is their problem and they should bear the consequences of not knowing the material well enough. Should I work so hard each year, only to protect the copiers from their own faults?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
What to do if ellipses are already in a text What should I do to let a reader know that in a quote the ellipses aren't mine and have been placed by the original author? This is the quote:  My home university did a study of its alumni a few years back, and they discovered that out of all the various degree subjects, the one that led to the highest average income was ... mathematics. (Stewart, Letters, 1)

What is the axiological basis of the preference of truth to falsity? Axiologically speaking, why is truth the preferred logical value by humans? In general, why do we prefer true statements to false ones? What about the value of true makes a statement "right," while false is "wrong?" Specifically, why do true statements seem to be valued higher than false statements and why does our day-to-day language seem to favor factual statements?

Why are true and false the only truth values used in mathematics? Why do we use only true and false? It is possible to have many states in-between in fuzzy logic and other many-valued logics. If we assign numbers to true and false, such as 1 and 0 respectively, what would be the logical interpreation of -1, i, j or k (with i,j,k as defined for quaternions)?  Is there any reason for this dichotomy? What type of statement would have these truth values if such a statement existed?

What punctuation should I use with a quote like this? I have this sentence:  Executive order 9066 allowed "the Secretary of War and the Military Commanders ... to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may impose."My question is should a comma go before this quote? Or should I use a colon? Or does this quote not need punctuation before it? And why?

Does the Bible ever mention class systems? Does the Bible ever talk about class systems? If so what does it say about them? Does it give a recommended class hierarchy at any point? Would a classless society be allowed?See also this question at politics se (there are links to more questions at other religious sites there).

{  "personalized_answer": "Based on your past questions and detailed descriptions, it seems you have a good understanding of UK tax rules and how they apply to different scenarios. However, calculating your PAYE tax for the year exactly can be challenging due to the complexity of the tax system and the various factors that influence your tax liability. Here are some key points to consider:1. **Savings Interest and Higher Rate Tax**: You mentioned that you earn over £42,000, which means you are subject to higher rate tax on your savings interest. HMRC will automatically deduct the correct amount of tax from your savings interest, so you don't need to do anything special. Just ensure that your savings accounts are set up correctly to reflect your tax status.2. **Pension Contributions and Tax Relief**: The tax relief on pension contributions is a bit more complex. The £20 of basic rate tax that your pension provider claims back is a form of "relief at source." The additional £20 you receive from HMRC is a tax refund for the higher rate tax you've paid. This is a two-step process, and you don't need to do anything special to claim it. Just ensure that your pension contributions are correctly reported to HMRC.3. **Tax Rebates and Unemployment**: When filling out HMRC forms, it's important to be honest and accurate. If your wife is expecting to start looking for work in the next couple of weeks, it might be best to choose the second option, as it more accurately reflects her future plans. This will ensure that any potential tax rebates are calculated correctly.4. **Business Expenses**: When setting up your business, you can claim expenses related to setting up your business, such as domain names, website setup, and initial advertising. However, expenses incurred before you start trading might be more challenging to claim. It's best to consult HMRC guidelines or a tax professional to ensure you are claiming expenses correctly.5. **Hourly Contracting vs. Annual Salaried Employment**: When comparing rates, consider not just the hourly rate or salary, but also factors like pension contributions, sick leave, and other benefits. Additionally, think about the stability and security of the job, as well as the potential for future growth and opportunities.In summary, while you can make educated guesses about your tax liability, the exact amount is often determined by HMRC based on your income and deductions. It's always a good idea to keep accurate records and consult with a tax professional if you have complex situations."}
