You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Writing rule which states that two causes for the same superpower is bad writing I've read somewhere that there is this writing rule stating that, for some superpower, it would be less believable if two completely different settings are present in order to obtain the same superpower. In the article, I remember it mentioned in the movie Spiderman (which I've not watched), the protagonist and another character gain the power through different means.What's this rule and does it have a name?

Is 'Sold Count' a good term I am writing a technical document, and in it I want to refer to the number of units sold for each product. I want to make it concise, and 'sold count' comes to mind. Does this term sound right? Are there better alternatives?

Exercise with pulmonary stenosis I have mild congenital pulmonary stenosis, which Wikipedia defines as:  outflow of blood from the right ventricle of the heart is obstructed  at the level of the pulmonic valve. This results in the reduction of  flow of blood to the lungs.It doesn't affect me at all in my daily life. Recently I thought I should start regular exercises, so I try to jog from time to time. What I want to ask are:How to tell if I am just using that as an excuse or am I really at my limit? My jogging habits are always run a little, walk a little, run a little, walk a little. I guess I switch when I am slightly out of breath.I understand these are more medical related, but none of the doctors I have visited can tell me anything in depth.Is there a particular type of exercises that are good for people like me?Would weight training be related to this at all?

Can I sleep on a airplane tray table? Or rather, how heavy can the airplane tray table support?I am afraid that if I use one of those flight pillows (https://familyshop.notyourchild.com/products/travelsky-inflatable-travel-pillow-foldable-for-airplanes-train-sleeping-flocking-pvc-soft-head-neck-rest-support-travel-pillows-2) and assert my upper body onto the tray, it might break.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How to trick the reader into thinking they're following a redshirt instead of the protagonist? I'm currently planning a "magical girl" story, and I thought of an interesting way to start it, rather than launching straight into the backstory. It opens with a woman in her mid-thirties, complete with ponytail of death, walking through a city market while being stalked by a shadowy monster.What I want readers to expect is that the woman is either going to be killed by the monster, or saved from it in the nick of time by the heroine. What actually happens is that when the monster finally attacks, the woman transforms into a magical girl, beats the everloving crap out of the monster, and then destroys it with a magical laser beam. Surprise! She is the heroine.I want to try and preserve this surprise as best I can, and make the readers think they're following a redshirt or one-off character instead of the protagonist. Not referring to her by name until after the reveal will help, but it's probably not enough. What else can I do to achieve this?(I'm aware of answers on other questions to the effect of "don't trick your readers". In my case, this is supposed to be a pleasant surprise, so I feel like it's okay.)

How should my script refer to a character who's currently disguised as another character? I've recently resumed writing a series of scripts for an anime I've been planning. One of the characters has the ability to shape-shift, and there are several scenes in which she initially appears disguised as another character, before shape-shifting back into her normal self.So far, when writing these scenes, I've referred to the character using the name of the person she's disguised as, and only switched back to her real name after she transforms back again. However, the top answers to these questions suggest that I shouldn't do that; scripts are production documents, and it's imperative that the crew know exactly who's supposed to be in each scene, hence I should always refer to characters by their real names.But in the case of a character who's disguised as another character, how do I do this while also making it clear that they're pretending to be someone else right now?

How to avoid constantly starting paragraphs with "The character did this" "The character did that"? This is one of the tics I've noticed in my writing recently, and it's starting to bug me. Almost every single one of my paragraphs, particularly during dialogue sequences, starts with "The character did this". The main exceptions are when I use "'Quote', attribution, 'continuance'" instead.Here's a brief example:"I'll come visit you every now and again, if I'm not too busy," said Electron.Colin smiled. "I'm sure the other patients will appreciate that as well," he said. "You been to the children's ward yet?""Not yet," said Electron. "I think I'll leave that for last. The kids won't want me to go, you know?"Colin nodded. "You're a good man, Electron," he said. "I think we're gonna get along just fine. It's a pleasure to have you in my city."Electron returned the mayor's smile. "It's a pleasure to be here," he said.How do I get out of this habit? Or is this not worth worrying about?

Protagonist constantly has to have long words explained to her. Will this get tedious? A while back, I redrafted my NaNoWriMo 2017 story, but it still needs another draft. This question is about one of the concerns I have.The story takes place in a medieval fantasy setting, and the protagonist is a homeless orphan of about fourteen. As a result, she has a somewhat limited education, and at various points has to have long or complex words explained to her. At first I inserted these moments in order to underscore her limited education, but I kept on inserting them in order to pad things out just that little bit more.An example: the villain, whose thieves' guild the protagonist has infiltrated, is describing their master plan, and refers to a "network of clandestine tunnels" under the city. The protagonist's partner notices her confusion, leans over, and whispers, "'Clandestine' means 'secret'".I don't have access to the full draft right now, but off the top of my head, this happens at least six times in the space of 41,000 words, including once during what's supposed to be a very dramatic and emotional climax. I'm worrying that this is too frequent, and that it might get tedious or distract from the story somewhat. Will it? Or am I overthinking it?

How do I write transitions between thinking and speaking? I've just downloaded an open-source script-writing program, and have started converting the scripts for an anime I've been writing into industry-standard formatting.There are a few points in the scripts where a character says something out loud, then immediately thinks something else (which the audience hears in voiceover), or thinks something and then says something else out loud. In my (not-at-all industry-formatted) scripts, I've indicated these like so:  CHARACTER: Follow me, and stay quiet. We'll be out of here shortly. (in thought) I hope.Or:  CHARACTER: (in thought) This isn't good. (out loud) Guys, we need to get out of here now--I already know that I need to change "(in thought)" to "(V.O.)", but other than that, how do I convert these into industry-standard formatting?

Under what circumstances were F1 teams allowed to re-use old chassis built by other teams? It used to be the case that new F1 teams could re-use outdated chassis designs built by other teams, however I'm confused about the circumstances under which they could do so.In 1992, Andrea Moda were not allowed to use an updated version of the Coloni C4 chassis from 1991.In 2006, Toro Rosso were allowed to use an updated version of the Red Bull RBR1 chassis from 2005.That same year, Super Aguri were not allowed to use an updated version of the BAR 007 from 2005, but they were allowed to use an updated version of the Arrows A23 from 2002.To me, there doesn't seem to be any consistency to these decisions.What exactly were the rules governing whether new teams could re-use existing chassis designs? Were there specific circumstances in which teams could or could not use them, which would explain the situations outlined above? Or it was arbitrary and determined on a case-by-case basis?

Do these pictures depict David Hogg after two separate crises? A post circulating on social media - 48,000 shares and counting so far - depicts still images of two news reports, one in California in August 2017 and one in Florida in February 2018 after the Parkland school shooting.The post alleges that both images depict the same man, David Hogg:The allegation is that he is a "crisis actor", paid to pretend to be a witness/survivor of events that he was not actually present at, or that did not take place at all. I know there were similar allegations about the Sandy Hook shooting a couple of years back.I don't think we can answer whether he's a crisis actor or not and I don't know what the event he "witnessed" in August 2017 is. Is it the same man in both of these images?

Can EU member states reject the new copyright legislation? The European Parliament has recently voted in favour of planned reforms to copyright legislation, including the controversial Articles 11 and 13. This BBC News article about the vote states (emphasis mine):  It is now up to member states to approve the decision. If they do, they will have two years to implement it once it is officially published.This suggests that member states have the option to reject the new copyright laws, and choose not to implement them. Is this correct? Or will they have to implement the new laws whether they approve of them or not?This isn't a "Please tell me Article 13 can still be cancelled!" question. A lot of people seem to believe that the new rules are now set in stone, the article seems to suggest otherwise, and I'm genuinely curious what the actual situation is.

Has anyone ever taken pole position without setting any fastest sector times? During qualifying for the 2018 Mexican Grand Prix, Max Verstappen very nearly took pole position despite not setting the fastest time in any of the three sectors. (Other drivers had gone faster than him in individual sectors, but lost time in the other sectors.) Ultimately, Daniel Ricciardo pipped him to pole position by about 0.03s.If Max had managed to take pole without "going purple" in any one sector, would that have been the first time it had happened? Or has anyone managed that before?

Have Antifa members used an inverted red triangle as a symbol? Facebook recently removed an advert for Donald Trump's re-election campaign that prominently featured an image of an inverted red triangle. Nazi Germany used an almost identical symbol to label communists and other political opponents, and the advert was thus deemed to contain a "hate symbol", in violation of Facebook's policies.In response, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh claimed the symbol was used not for its Nazi connotations, but because the Antifa movement (which the advert strongly criticised) uses the symbol:The inverted red triangle is a symbol used by antifa, so it was included in an ad about antifa.I recognise that this may be a difficult question to answer, due to the nebulous nature of Antifa and the possibility of false flag accounts muddying the waters. However, I do believe it's possible that some Antifa members, aware of the symbol's historic meaning, have co-opted it.Are there any documented instances of Antifa members using an inverted red triangle as an identifying symbol?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
are what we translate as "adjectives", "nouns", etc, the same kind of words in no indo-european languages? This question comes from questions in japanese SE. Keiyōshi 形容詞 are translated as adjectives. Meishi 名詞 are translated as nouns. But are they really the same kind of words that we mean with nouns, adjectives, etc. in English? I've already found 3 examples that arises a lot of doubts in me if they are the same thing. The first is a japanese word that I can't remember right now but that I've seen used as a noun, adjective or verb. May be there are words like these in English or Spanish, but I'm not sure if they are the same. For example the word paddle can be a verb, a noun or an adjective in English. The second is japanese words that they see as a noun and that we see as adjectives. The word "next" for japaneses is a clear noun. They know that it can be used as an adjective, but when giving an example of when it is used as a noun (what it really is according to japanese), I got this "when is the next?" that is a sentence that could come in a conversation between 2 persons about events , and one of them ask the other "when is the next (event)?" . wouldnt it be for english speakers, still an adjective because it modifies an implicit noun (event)? And the third is the word "suki" and similar words, that they see as a verb and it's translated as "to like" but it is used next to the verb desu (to be) So my question is, are what we translate as adjectives, verbs, etc, from other non indoeuropean languages, really what we understand as verbs, adjectives, etc?

Did Maradona ever score a goal with his right foot? I was hearing one of Pele's declaration stating Maradona couldn't score goals with his right foot. I thought he was talking in general, but then I started to think about goals made by him with his right foot and I couldn't remember any. I made a little research about this and I couldn't find any goal scored by him with his right foot, even though I clearly didn't watch all 300+ goals he made in his career (I'm not sure if all of them were recorded on TV by the way).I also remembered he used to kick the ball to the center of the field with his left foot even when he was in the right side of the field, giving the pass with a "Rabona" instead of with his right foot, because he was too much of a left-footed player. So, did he ever score a goal with his right foot, or did he never score one this way?

Which are the canonical sources for reading about Isa in Islam? Once I've read that Islam says Isa is going to return to Earth and fight a war. This is a different version of character personality that's given for Jesus in christianity were he says "Put your sword back in its place. for all who draw the sword will die by the sword". (I suppose Islam doesnt see the source where is quoted him saying that as a true source since it seems to be contradictory with someone later returning to fight a war) . I'm interested to read more about him in Islam to see how different they are portraited 

Did the italian parliament deny what mayor of Alzano Lombardo say about people in his city not being hospitalized because hospitals are full? There is a report from Italy in many webpage which says  "There are many elderly people at home with breathing difficulties.  They are not hospitalized because the hospitals are full" said the  mayor of Alzano Lombardo Carmelo BertocchiCoronavirus updateSome italians in forums say this is an hoax and one said the italian parliament denied this. Is there any record of the italian parliament denying this statement by Alzano Lombardo mayor?

Is Coronavirus transmission affected by the season of the host country / hemisphere? First when the Coronavirus outbreak happened in China, some people argued that the outbreak had to do with a supposed faulty chinese health care system, due to China not being a "developed country". But now in South Korea and Italy, supposed "developed countries" the cases are increasing even at over a 100% rate per day some days. Now in Italy the first cases appeared apparently in 31 January and in South Korea apparently in 20 January. So in 3 / 4 weeks those countries jumped from  units to hundreds / over a thousand cases. Yet in another "developed country" like Australia, the first case was reported 25 January , but the country was able to keep the number of cases below / in 23 for a month. Can be a factor contributing to the outbreaks in South Korea / Italy the fact that they are in the northern hemisphere / winter , and that Australia is in the southern hemisphere / summer by February? Could an outbreak as fast as those which happened in South Korea / Italy happen in a country which is in summer by the time it happens?

Is there any language where each character is pronounced differently depending on the word it's in? Languages like Japanese have different pronunciations for each character (in the kanji system in this case) , a kanji character can have up to 20 different pronunciations depending on the the word it is in. Is there or was there any language where each character is pronounced differently depending on the word it's in?

Could a drug used to treat patients of a infectious disease be used preventively in possible asymptomatic patients? According to Japanese flu drug reportedly shows promise against coronavirus in clinical trials  A Japanese drug used to treat new strains of the flu has shown promise  in being effective against the coronavirus in clinical trials.    Infected patients who were given the drug in Wuhan and Shenzhen tested  negative for the coronavirus after a median of four days, compared  with a median of 11 days for those who were not treated with the drugIn my country, 15,000 persons have to return from the hot spot areas for Coronavirus of Spain and Italy. A few days ago, a sport team traveled to the hot spot of Milan, and 1/3 returned infected but without Symptoms. People who arrives to my country from other countries are inmediately quarantine, but several times they violate the quarantine presenting a risk for other people. Could a drug used to treat patients of a infectious disease, be used preventively in possible asymptomatic patients?

How does self-defense apply to bodyguards? Suppose you have a bodyguard who sees someone is about to attack you. The attacker is not being a threat to the bodyguard but a dangerous threat to the bodyguard's employer (he could be killed) . Can the bodyguard act harming the attacker to prevent him from killing someone, even if he isnt the one who is being personally attacked or he will be punished if he does?

Is there an inflection point in Coronavirus outbreaks where you can't contain the epidemy anymore? So far only a few countries have been able to reduce through policies the number of people infected in their countries after being exposed to thousands of infected, viz. China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong), Singapore, and South Korea. In Europe, several countries have been trying to reduce the number of infected people or the number of new cases through quarantines, and after 1 or 2 weeks, it doesn't seem to me that their measures are working. Are they? Is there an inflection point in Coronavirus outbreak where you can't contain the epidemic anymore?

Does an employer have any obligation to report an employee with possible covid-19 symptoms? Suppose you have an employee with fever during the covid-19 pandemic. Is there any law which makes mandatory to report your employee to the doctor, health authorities, or whatever for him/her to make a covid-19 test to check if he has the disease or not, or are the employers completely exempt of this duty?

[rank0]:[W707 15:13:31.660544084 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Is investing all your savings into a small number of individual stocks risky? I want to invest 90% of my savings into stock market and split between 4-6 stocks.  How risky is this and is it a bad idea.  I feel like the stock market goes up over time so unless something like 2008 depression happens again there is actually not that much risk?Note that I'm trying to turn this into a form of income and not simply getting decent returns for retirement etc.  I am okay with reasonable risk so I can work less hopefully.

What causes a stock to make an EXTREMELY big move in a short period? Today (8/19/20) I was paper trading a stock REDU.  I was in a short position without a stop loss and stock went from 6.74 to 7.48 or over 10% in a span of less than 30 seconds, faster than I could react to get out.  Is this due to low trade volume and the bid and ask became so wide?  or someone manipulating the market?My question is how can I avoid this scenario in the future.  Would a stop loss work to get me out? or avoid these types of stocks in general.

Is there any reason to not buy if mortgage is comparable to rent? I'm curious: Say if you could buy a property or choose to rent and the mortgage per month on the property is similar to (or even lower) than the rent in your area, is there any reason to not buy?Assuming you are not looking to move and stay in the area long term.Also a follow up question, if you paid half the mortgage somewhere and want to leave, is it easy to transfer the mortgage to someone else and get what you paid so far back?

limiting losses when shorting stock First time shorting stock just want to make sure I limit my losses correctly.  Say I short 100 shares of SPY and $272 and I  want to get out(cover my short) if it goes above $285 would the following sequence be right?Initiate transaction Action:SELL SHORT 100 shares of SPY.Initiate second transaction Action: BUY Type:STOP 100 shares SPY at $285 stop price.

Live off of $100k in savings for as long as possible What is the best way to live off of a set amount e.g. $100k - $150k in savings with no income? Assuming you can relocate to anywhere in the US with low cost of living, can you live off of this for 20+ years?

Is margin interest applied to intraday trades? I'm trying to understand how the margin interest charge is calculated when you borrow money from a broker like Fidelity to buy stocks for  intraday trades. If the rate is 8% then is the daily charge should be 8% / 365 or 0.0219% of how much you borrowed?  Or if you buy and then sell the stock on the same day  then the   broker does not charge you any interest?

Is it possible for lions to survive in real life on bugs The song Hakuna Matata from The Lion King is all about eating bugs when you are a lion. I was wondering if this is actually a real life fact that lions can survive on bugs or did the Lion King makers just make this fact up to make kids less scared of bugs?

Is "Can you come to the game on Saturday?" a question or a request? Someone asks me "Can you come to the game on Saturday?"  I replied yes but thinking they are asking me a question and not actually tell me to come.  The asker assumed that I would come and got annoyed when I didn't show up.  Who is at fault?

Average performance for long term stock investors? What's the average performance of long term stock investors in terms of % profit per year?  I want to know how I am doing compared to other people.  Is there such a statistic?

How to tackle the bibliographic work as an entering PhD student? I'll be starting my PhD in the next fall. I already looked over the internet for advice for a beginner, even read two books on the subjects. Still, there is one point I haven't seen discussed as I wanted, it's the time and the way the student should be investing in catching up on his field and his specific topic, I'm speaking about the bibliographic part. For sure a student needs a lot of (continuous) input, but at the end he'll be solely judged on his output. From my previous research project, I'm not really confident in my way of balancing between going through articles/textbook material and trying to solve my own problematics. To be honest, it sometimes feels like a sneaky way of procrastinating: I'd tell myself that I'm still not ready to tackle my problem and that I need to make a little "detour" by existing works; and when it's done I don't feel more at ease to answer my questions. Or is it a normal aspect of research?In my specific case, I'll be working on a quite new subject (string theory) when I only had advanced lecture of quantum field theory and general relativity; so I'm thinking about going through the canonical textbook on the subject during the summer, do most of the exercises and derivations in there (which already represents hundreds of hours invested), maybe revising some mathematical tools I need to be really familiar with. Once I'll have a general idea of the topic I'll jump to the main articles in relation to my thesis. I also know that I will be using numerical tools (Monte Carlo methods) and will need to get conformable with that. So far I only have a superficial knowledge and use of the tool.Does it seem like a good use of my time? I already know that time and willpower are limited resources in grad school and I really don't want my desire to do well to burn me out from the beginning.

Why does the minor pentatonic scale sounds "oriental" to me? I've been training my minor pentatonic scale on guitar for a while (mostly playing it in A with the first position) and it always sounded somewhat oriental to me, in the sense of the musical airs you'd find in music to set the plot in Orient, musical clichés. I am not sure to be really clear in trying to share this impression, but I, then, read that in Orient they used to split the octave in 5 tones, and not 7 as we did in Europe, would it be because the pentatonic as only five notes (by definition) that my sub

Looking for advice on my self-taught music education Until a year ago, I had absolutely no music education, and I decided to change that around this period, well more exactly I picked up on (acoustic) guitar as a hobby and from there gained interest in knowing more about music. And so I discovered some theory: scales, chords, keys, harmony, melody and rhythm on websites and in some books. I also followed Wright lectures "Listening to music" http://oyc.yale.edu/ and read the first chapters of his book on this course (or vice-versa). I've gained knowledge but I'm not sure about the next steps, should I try applying it on my guitar ans starting to transcribe/compose? Listen the most to the broadest set of music genres? Start focusing on one? I'm a bit lost in my learning path, and would be glad to hear some suggestions.

How can I increase my focus and pleasure in reading English? After working on my oral skills in English for a couple of years, I know more interested in learning written English, specially by reading. I have been reading a couple of books over the last months (Game of Thrones, the whole Sherlock Holmes, Lord of the Rings, some Stephen King...) and articles (the Guardian, the New York Times, the Atlantic, mostly). But although I've felt some improvements in my understanding, and learned lots of words, I'm still not enjoying reading English as much as I do enjoy reading French (which is my natural language), and I'm not even what you could call a literary (checking my other stackexchange affiliations would prove you that...). When reading English I just follow the plot, but I'm really totally insensitive in the style of writing, in the choice of words, ... I hardly realized that when reading a few pages of French the other day, it's even way easier to focus on what I read when it is French than English.Fellow who learned English as a second (or third, or more...) language, have already felt that? Have you been through that? How long did it take? Or is it just a never ending job in progress but I'll never reach the ease I have with French?

How to improve finger style guitar playing I am a competent, but not amazing, guitar player who is very comfortable with the usual chords as well as basic fingerpicking patterns. I would like to take it to the next level and be able to improvise and play something along the lines of (though not initially as complicated as) this by James Taylor: 
                
             - starting at about 2:40. Another example of something that I would love to do is 
                
            . As opposed to learning a particular song, which is fine, I am more interested in learning general techniques that I can improvise with when I am playing around on the guitar.What resources/tutorials/lessons would you recommend that can help me play interesting things like in these videos? 

What does "her mama leaned hard" in this Emmylou Harris Song mean? I was listening to the song "Red Dirt Girl" by Emmylou Harris, and didn't understand one of the lyrics: "her mama leaned hard." What does this mean?Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hardGot in trouble with a boy from townI did find one definition from this blog, but it doesn't seem to be what I am looking for: "To lean hard you must get under God’s feet and submit to His plans and purposes, even if you do not see them fully or understand them at all. Leaning means shifting all the weight of the burden from your shoulders to His."

How to gracefully walk away from coauthored paper I am working on a coauthored paper which I would like to step away from. How can I do so very tactfully and gracefully? I want to step away because I don't quite agree with the direction the paper is taking in terms of analysis; the publication prospects are not terrific; and, frankly, I am not sure if I fully believe the results (our setting is not very "clean," meaning that there are several alternative explanations). I don't necessarily want to say all of these things to them.Another detail is that the coauthors are two people at my current institution. I am going to be transitioning to another institution (in another state) in the next few months. Note this is not one of my main reasons to walk away, but being away will make it somewhat harder to collaborate. It will also be nice to get this off my plate so I can focus more on other projects.

Fungible Money Question Suppose that there are two people, A and B.  Each has a physical dollar bill.  Each donates the dollar bill to an organization.  The organization buys something for a dollar.First suppose that the organization buys the something with one of the two physical dollar bills.  If A claims that his money bought the item, then he may or may not be correct.  This is analogous for B.  All you would have to do is check the dollar and figure out who it originally came from.However, suppose that the bank deposits the money into an online bank account.  Then the money is truly fungible.  If A claims that the organization bought something with his money, how would we evaluate this claim?  Does it even make any sense for A to make this claim?  What if B also makes the claim?

Data Source for 2012 US Congress and US Senate Elections I need to find a good data source for the 2012 United States Congress and Senate elections.  I have found this: http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2012/federalelections2012.shtml  The problem is that it is in a not-so-user-friendly format in Excel.  And an even harder-to-use format in PDF.I have found the State Legislative returns in a good format at http://www.indstate.edu/polisci/klarnerpolitics.htm.  I would ideally have the same thing as this.Any kind of CSV, Stata, etc. would be fantastic.Any tips on where I should look?

Expand Bass Guitar Playing Beyond Root Notes I am fairly new to the bass guitar and I'm in a band.  So far, I almost always just play the root note of the chord.  I sometimes hold it until a new chord and sometimes repeatedly play this same note.The root notes I commonly play are C, D, B, F#, E, etc.   For example, a song may be D G Bm A. What I am doing is fine, but I feel like it would be great to branch out and play things besides just the root.  How should I go about this?  What are examples?

Punctuation inside of quotation marks with technical phrases If I am not mistaken, one should insert a period, question mark, etc. inside of the quotation mark in quoted speech.  For example,   The man continued, "The sky is purple today."  My question concerns the use of punctuation when the thing within the quotation marks is a specific technical thing.  For example,   The correct computer password is "AbCd!".Should the period be before or after the final quotation mark in the last example?

What Defines a Utah Accent? I have heard a number of people refer to the "Utah accent."  What is it that distinguishes a Utah accent from others?I have noticed that, in some cases, people from Utah omit the 't' from words such as 'Layton' and 'mountain.'  In other cases, it seems like they pronounce 'milk' with an 'e' instead of an 'i.'  'Creek' sounds like 'crick.' 'Mormon' like 'Marmon.' I am not sure if any of these are specific to Utah.Finally, what about differences between regions, for example, what is a Cache Valley accent? 

Where Can I Find Historical Candidate Photos of U.S. Elections (both winners and losers)? I am looking to do a research project involving photos of United States political candidates (probably gubernatorial, but potentially Senate and/or Congressional). I would like photos from the 1920s or 1930s until about the 1980s. Digital would be wonderful, but print is also fine.I think that these would exist in many different newspapers (The League of Women Voters possibly published this as well). A central database would obviously be ideal, but I am doubtful that one of these exists (with both winning and losing candidates). But for only winning candidates, it would still be helpful.I have poked around some and have not had great success yet.Any suggestions of where I should look?

Is a comma appropriate in "Sounds good, thanks." If I am writing "Sounds good, thanks.", is a comma appropriate between "Sounds good" and "thanks"? It seems awkward/too much to instead do "Sounds good; thanks." or "Sounds good. Thanks." Would the same rule as above apply for situations such as "OK, thanks." and "Yes, please."?

[rank0]:[W707 15:22:04.878586631 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Shall I ask my agency to overturn negative client feedback? I work for a writing agency. A few days ago, a client asked us to do some work for his website. The client said it was 'proofreading'. I did the work, the agency approved it. It was sent to the client for final approval.The client wrote back to say that what he actually wanted was his text rewritten so the site sold better. I wrote back to the agency to say this pretty much constituted a new job. The agency agreed so I got on with the work.I resubmitted and the agency approved it - again! It was sent to the client for final approval. I waited a few days and the client rejected it. He wrote back to say that the work was low quality and he could have done a better job himself. My agency were very nice about it, I got paid regardless, but it left a blemish on my stats, it's the first time a client has rejected a piece of my work.I am considering writing to my agency and asking them to overturn the negative feedback because1 - the client was vague about what they wanted - and in the first place, they described what they wanted incorrectly;2 - it was a new client, so we had no previous examples of what the client liked to work from3 - it's clear that the client had something very specific in mind, but they were not able to articulate their needs or show us the kind of thing they had in mind.I kept to the description as much as I could - short, concise, selling the site, a bit humorous. There was nothing I could do save getting inside the client's head. Because of this one negative piece of feedback I am now nearly halfway down my agency's ladder of writers, whereas before I was at the top.Should I write to my agency about this or just swallow it? I could do the latter, but I still feel an injustice is being done somewhere. 

Article I wrote has been published under another name - should I raise this with the publisher? I do part-time copywriting work and over the weekend I wrote a ~1500 word paid article for an online publication. It was a lot of research and toil, I had half a day to do it and I finally submitted the thing at 2am on Sunday. It was a very tricky piece.Now I notice the article has been published, with some minor edits, but under a different name. The client has used one of their own employees as the author. I wasn't aware that I was ghostwriting. Should I raise this with the publisher? Should credit not be given where it is due - or should I remain quiet unless I irritate them? I'm quite new to this but should they not at least have said it would be credited to someone else?

Should I include the name[s] of copywriting agencies I write for on my CV? I'm a startup copywriter, and some agencies request a CV on application to join. Should I include the name[s] of some of the agencies I already work with and which send me jobs?

Client has asked for a piece to be rewritten after agency acceptance of my submission. How much should I charge? Yesterday I was given a job which was to proofread a website and make any changes "where necessary". That's all the brief said. I did so, amended any typos etc, changed some grammar and spiced it up here and there. I submitted my piece and my agency accepted it, meaning I get paid. Great.I am a freelance copywriter. Today I get a message saying that the client says there was a "misunderstanding". He says he wants the text rewritten in a way that sells the site more, not just changed here and there. Clearly my agency thought I had fulfilled his brief, because they accepted my submission, but he is saying he wants the thing basically rewritten from scratch as I understand it.How much do I charge for this revision? I will be paid X for my original submission. But should I charge X again, because this sounds like a new job, half of X or less? I love my agency and don't want to annoy them, but it seems that the client's original brief was really vague. I am unsure of what to do.

Should one use first or third person terminology when discussing one's character? This is not about viewing the character, but how to refer to them verbally in conversation. On these and other boards I see plenty of people using both first and third person terminology, e.g. "I did this" vs "my character did this"; or "my character prefers magic over weaponry" rather than "I prefer magic over weaponry" in the context of the game. Speaking in the third person makes it seem like the character is an independent entity, which they clearly are not since their existence depends on that of the player.I find this confusing. Sometimes the player will make the character do things the player would not do in real life in such a situation, but then, it is still the player making those choices. My player is female but I am male, I still refer to her as "I" - is this not correct [by "correct" I mean whatever is considered normal practice]?I am tagging this question with Skyrim, because, unlike with, e.g The Witcher, the player creates the character from the ground up [I am sure there are many other games when the player has to do the same but I don't know what they are].

Winstad Manor: Will my firepit go if I change my small house to an entryway? I just bought Hearthfire in Oldrim and was very keen to get going with building Windstad Manor. I should have focused on the main house construction rather than the furnishings and I put a firepit and cooking pot in the small house which will become the entrance.Now I realise that when I extend the house I won't want this firepit there. When I convert this small house to an entryway, will the firepit/cooking pot disappear? I would prefer this. In the future I will just focus on construction of the main areas rather than any interior furnishings.

Can I dimiss or kill my steward but keep my bard? I live in Winstad Manor. I just live with my wife currently. In an earlier save I hired Valdimir as a steward and Sonir as a bard. I liked Sonir [as long as she doesn't sing "The Dragonborn Comes", it's not a good number for her] and want to keep her, but, when I hired Valdimir as a steward beforehand he started wandering in and out of the house all the time, eating bread and sitting in the private bedroom, which is clearly not on.How do I get rid of him and keep Sonir? I take it that the only thing to do, without mods, is to kill him. If I do so, will Sonir stay?

Is it possible to change the music in quest mods to something else? I downloaded a quest mod, The Cathedral on Steam for Oldrim, and it's pretty good but the music isn't. I feel it would benefit much more from an ambient soundtrack. I was wondering if it's possible to add my own music to this particular mod instead of using its own.Important: the music for the main game must be unchanged and should play as normal when outside of the mod area. Thanks for any ideas :)

Can I re-cook potatoes stored half-roasted in the fridge? The other day I roasted some new potatoes in olive oil, with some thyme and garlic and added some lemon later. The only problem was I didn't roast them for long enough, I roasted them for 45 mins at 200C, it should probably have been an hour. I ate some of them anyway but they were quite hard. I stored them in the fridge, they've been there for about three days. Can I re-roast them? They look very nice with the thyme and garlic and lemon. Or should I throw them away? What's the best way to cook them if I do keep them?

Can I safely disable DLCs in Oldrim if they have already been started? Yesterday I bought the Dragonborn DLC for Oldrim on PC. I don't like it that much at the moment and would just prefer to have Dawnguard/Hearthfire. Sure, I could just not play any of those DB quests and not visit Solsteim, but I played it for a bit yesterday and have a few quests from DB in my journal, I would prefer that things are cleaner.Seeing there are no locations within Skyrim which DB adds, would it be possible to just untick the DB DLC from the Skyrim menu and load a previous pre-DB game?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Grades vs. projects in job application I am teaching computer science undergraduates, who will most likely go to work in the software industry. They often ask me for career advice and I want to know what advice to give them. Specifically, suppose a student can choose between two elective courses:Course A has a relatively low average grade (60-70/100), but during the homework assignments, the students build an industry-level project.Course B has a relatively high average grade (80-90/100), the homework assignments are simple and not industry-level.On one hand, course A lowers the student's average grade, so there is more chance the student will be filtered out based on a low average, even before the interview.On the other hand, if the student does get to the interview stage, having a strong project to show is a big advantage.I know that each work-place is different, but I would still be happy if there is a general rule-of-thumb to help the student decide: what is more helpful for getting a job in the software industry - a high average grade, or a strong project?

Pandemic - reduced rule-set for beginners I have recently started playing pandemic, and was overwhelmed by the amount of rules.Is there a reduced set of rules, easier to learn and remember but still fun, that can be used by beginners until they get used to the game?EDIT: My goal is not to make the game easier to win - it is to make the game easier to learn how to play. Instead of learning all rules at once, the team can learn the rules one by one. For example, suppose there are 10 rules (just an arbitrary number). Then instead of remembering all these rules at once, we can start with 5 rules, then add a new rule each play, until we remember and play by all rules.

How can I convert a linear narrative into a branching narrative? Suppose I would like to create a text adventure game, but my imagination is not sufficient for creating a whole game. But there are fiction books (in the public domain) that are very imaginative and could potentially make a great game. The main problem is that, a standard fiction book is sequential, while in a game there are many branches. Even if I have, say, only 10 branches, I still have to write 9 of these on my own.Is there a process that can make this easier? A structured procedure by which I can work, that can help me convert a novel to a text adventure, with minimal need to use my "rusty" imagination?I looked around the web and found some links that apparently discuss this topic, but with few details:Five tips for turning a book into an interactive game - mainly discusses what should be in a book in order to be able to make a game out of it, namely: scalability, strong characters, first-person narrative, and genre. But, it does not speak about the conversion process itself.What the heck is interactive fiction? - a subsection titled "Converting Fiction to IF" gives some hints: pick a shorter story, think about the choices your character makes, think how to display text on the page, think outside the page. Again, few details about the process itself are given.EDIT: thanks a lot to all the repliers for the wonderful ideas and the warm welcome!

Ice-cream-on-a-stick in refrigerator temperature In the summer, I used to make ice-cream-on-a-stick in various flavors. Some examples:Chocolate flavor: melted cocoa + honey + coconut oil + almond butter.Banana flavor: bananas + peanut butter + cinnamon + soy milk.I just mixed them, put in a mould, put a wooden stick in each hole, and put in the freezer. Then, I could grab one in the morning and eat on the way to work as a breakfast.Now, winter is coming and it is unpleasant to eat at freezer temperature, so I wonder if I can achieve the same effect in refrigerator temperature: is there an ingredient I can add to the mixture, that will make it freeze, and stick to the stick, in the refrigerator?

How to find a employer that allows staff to publish academic papers As a Ph.D. candidate, one of the things that I am looking for, when looking for a job, is the opportunity to continue publishing academic papers related to work. I know that there are some companies whose workers publish academic papers, such as: Google, Microsoft, IBM and Yahoo. I am wondering whether there is some website that compares companies according to how academic they are. E.g, counts the number of publications per worker in each company, etc. Is there any website that publishes such information?

Can I become flexible enough to touch the ground? I am 175 cm. high, 45 years old. When I stand with my legs straight and bow down, my palms are about 70 cm above the ground. I have done this daily for several weeks, hoping that I will improve in time, but the distance to the ground does not seem to shorten.Is there any exercise I can do, that will make me flexible enough so that I can touch the ground?

How can I prevent animals from marking my camp as their territory? Often, when I leave my tent during the day, cats and other animals come and pee in the corners and on the carpet. They probably do this to mark it as their territory. They don't come at night when I sleep inside. Besides building a fence around my tent, which is expensive and time-consuming, is there other way to convince animals that they shouldn't come?

The sheep and the wolves When I was a child, I was playing a game such as the following:The game is played on a standard chessboard, but only on the black squares.There are two players: the white player has a single white pawn which is the "sheep"; the black player has four pawns which are the "wolves".The players start at opposite sides of the board, and make a single diagonal step each turn.The goal of the wolves is to capture the sheep - surround it such that it cannot move.The goal of the sheep is to escape the wolves and get to the opposite side of the board.Recently I tried playing it again, but found out that I do not remember the exact rules. Specifically:* Is the sheep allowed to go backward, or only forward?* Are the wolves allowed to go backward, or only forward?We tried to play this game with all four combinations. In each combination, the game turned out to be too easy for one side and too difficult for the other side.What are the rules that make this game sufficiently challenging for both sides?

How to keep the legs healthy when climbing stairs My favorite sport is climbing staircases by foot, then going down by elevator and going up again by feet, etc. I feel it hurts the legs much less than jogging, since I don't 'fall' on my legs while climbing.Still, I would like to do if there are any risks of leg injuries when climbing stairs?In particular, what kind of shoes are best suited for this kind of sport? Currently I use simple walking shoes (not running shoes), is this good enough?

How to get rid of ants without harming the tree Several days ago I found in my garden hunderds of big black ants. What's worst: I traced them and found that their hole is at the base of my young Macademia tree.Can I get rid of the ants without harming the tree?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Tofu as a growing medium? I just had a strange idea of no actual significance, but I was just staring at a block of tofu and wondered if you could plant things in it. Has anyone tried this? How does/would tofu fair as a growing medium. How would plants grow differently in hard, medium, and soft tofu?

What is the functional role of the subtonic chord? In this chartthe subtonic major chord can come before the mediant and submedian chords. Does this imply that it has a tonic functionality? If so that seems counter-intuitive; it seems to share more in common with the dominant chord than the tonic. On the other hand, if it's a dominant function, why would you have a i-VII-III... progression? Wouldn't it make more sense for the VII to fall later, towards the end of the phrase.(Also I'm assuming that the VII actually refers to the bVII chord, but if I'm wrong please correct me on that)

How do I know where to place holes on an instrument? I've been trying to build a double reeded instrument out of plastic straws. I've run into a problem though, when I place fingering holes, the instrument doesn't seem to follow the $$f=/frac{nv}{4L}$$ formula. Is there a formula that would allow me to calculate where along the instrument I should place the holes?

Dill, cilantro, and fennel cross pollinating I've read several conflicting pieces of information on the growing of dill, cilantro, and fennel near one another. I've read that fennel and dill will grow well together and make good companion plants, however I've also read that they will cross pollinate to make a foul-smelling hybrid. I've read that dill and cilantro will cross pollinate to create a rather disgusting culinary useless hybrid, but I've also read that they can be beneficial to one another's growth. I have not, however, read anything on cilantro and fennel growing together. How do these three plants fare when grown with one another, and is there any risk of cross pollination or hybridization?To cut costs I am planning on using the seeds again. I (personally) don't particularly care about hybrids or GMOs, I just want to be able to use the plants as herbs. However, should the hybrids not be culinarily useful, I would begin to care.

How to put up my string items without tangling When I put up Christmas lights onto my house, I must first untangle them. Is there any way when I put them (or any similar item) away for them not to become tangle and knotted without buying something specifically for that purpose.

Is maral root useful as a companion plant? I was looking at rarer plants to grow for natural pesticide purposes and I was wondering how maral root fares. What conditions does this plant need to grow? At what temperature, water amounts, soil conditions, etc. can this plant grow in, is it hardy or highly sensitive? Also, will it interfere with other plants?

Use of diminished—major seventh chords Could someone please describe how and when a diminished-major chord would be used. How would one lead up to it, resolve it, and are there any rules about inversions with it? An explained example usage in common-practice music would be helpful.

How can I stop my skin from peeling? After I get a sunburn the next day my skin starts to peel. Is there a easy way to at least temporarily stop this from occurring?

Can shape water be used to make weapons? Out of curiosity I was looking at the Shape Water cantrip and I was wondering if this spell would be usable to create weapons. For instance if I used the cantrip first to move the water into the shape of a dagger, and then to freeze it, what properties would said dagger have?

Hydrangea's allelopathic effects on crops? I was wondering if hydrangea had any effects on the growth of other plants. Doing a google search only told me that hydrangeas are immune to juglone. However I'm more interested in the effects of hydrangea on other plants, will growing hydrangea have an effect on plants such as tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, or peppers? I know that hydrangea has cyanogenic glycosides, and I was hoping that this would help prevent pests, but I'm worried that it may also negatively impact the main plants.

[rank0]:[W707 15:29:21.203351440 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
