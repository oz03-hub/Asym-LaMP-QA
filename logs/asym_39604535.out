# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Is Boogiepop series connected to the Boogie music genre? Looking up the Oxford dictionary, the definition of "boogie" is:  A style of blues played on the piano with a strong, fast beat.From Wikipedia it is defined as:  Boogie (sometimes called post-disco) is a rhythm and blues genre of electronic dance music with close ties to the post-disco styleAs I am unfamiliar with the genre, I tried a few sample of boogie music. I don't really see it matches the atmosphere of the anime (neither the 2000 nor 2019 adaptation). Boogiepop himself "seems fond of whistling the prelude to Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" which is also not related to boogie genre.Also I don't see it too related to pop genre either.

Boogiepop and Others Promotional Trailer references 2019's "Boogiepop and Others" TV series has a promotional trailer. However the trailer is kind of "fake", because many footage are not present in the actual TV show.The main ones are:On Opera stageA man fighting a fire ability userBoogiepop walking closer to another girl, and the background switches with each swing from BoogiepopAre these referencing other unadapted stories in the series? If yes, which are those?

Meaning of telegraph code in the song "Planetes" The song Planetes in Guilty Crown begins with some telegraph encoding, which I think is Wabun code.Here is the YouTube link.My transcription is:-•-• -••-- •-- --•-- •- --•-• •-•-- -•--•which decodes to this:ni-yu-ya a-i-shi-te-ruNiyuya didn't make sense. Did I get something wrong?

In Master Keaton, is TV news being used as secret code based on real world practice? Vol.8 of Master Keaton starts with the TV broadcasting a news segment about 'a Lion was accidentally trapped inside the cage of leopards in some zoo near River Seine.' This was later explained that it symbolizes a royal family member being in danger overseas, and is used by the British government to secretly notify the related parties (agents?)Was this based on some real world practice?

Does Fez require controller which can vibrate? There are some FEZ puzzles which I can't solve. That led me to think that, maybe those require a controller which can provide vibration feedback (I am currently playing with keyboard). Is my guess correct?

Writing rule which states that two causes for the same superpower is bad writing I've read somewhere that there is this writing rule stating that, for some superpower, it would be less believable if two completely different settings are present in order to obtain the same superpower. In the article, I remember it mentioned in the movie Spiderman (which I've not watched), the protagonist and another character gain the power through different means.What's this rule and does it have a name?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
What happened to Hibiya and Hiyori after they broke out of the time loop? (It's been over four years since I watched Mekaku City Actors and it wasn't the most coherent anime, so please forgive me if I've gotten any details wrong or missed something obvious.)In the episode "Heat Haze Daze", Hibiya and Hiyori are trapped in an infinite time loop in which Hiyori keeps dying, and Hibiya keeps trying and failing to save her. They finally break out of the time loop (I presume) when   Hibiya sacrifices himself to save Hiyori's life.The next time we see them is when Haruka breaks open the back of a van to find them bound and gagged inside. I don't recall there ever being an explanation of how they got there.What happened to Hibiya and Hiyori between them breaking out of the time loop and Haruka finding them in the van? Who put them there, and why?

Why didn't Roberta kill these characters? In Part 4 of Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail, Shenhua attacks Roberta and is swiftly backed up by Sawyer and Rotton. Roberta breaks Sawyer's chainsaw and one of Shenhua's kukris, has the two held at gunpoint... then just kicks Rotton in the balls and walks away, sparing all three of them.I haven't watched Part 5 yet, but so far this is the only time Roberta has shown mercy in the entire OVA. Later on in Part 4, she reacts to Eda helping her by promising to kill her painlessly, yet here she spares three random strangers who were trying to kill her, two-thirds of whom were still armed in some capacity. I don't understand why.It could be that Roberta's just trying to catch up to the American soldiers and/or Garcia, and doesn't want to waste time killing them, but she doesn't seem to be in that much of a hurry - as I noted, she walks away from the incident in question. It could also just be that she's gone completely insane at this point, and trying to analyse her actions is a waste of time. But I'd like to try anyway.Why didn't Roberta kill Shenhua, Sawyer, and Rotton?To repeat: I haven't seen Part 5 yet, so I don't want to Google anything in case I stumble across any spoilers. If the answer is "watch Part 5", so be it.

Why wasn't this character killed immediately? In Persona 5, after you   steal Okumura's Treasure, his Shadow is killed by an unseen assassin. This happens in the very same cutscene, literally two seconds after the Phantom Thieves have left the room.By my understanding, this should have resulted in    an immediate mental shutdown.And yet nothing happens until   the press conference on October 12th. Depending on how long it took you to clear the Palace, that's up to three weeks later.Now, I understand that the out-of-universe reason for this is that if   Okumura had died the moment you cleared the Palaceit would have completely messed up the game's timeline of events. But in-universe, it doesn't make sense, especially considering that   the villains were relying on Okumura dying at exactly that moment, in order to implicate the Phantom Thieves in his death.How should this be reconciled? In-universe, why didn't this character die immediately?

How to trick the reader into thinking they're following a redshirt instead of the protagonist? I'm currently planning a "magical girl" story, and I thought of an interesting way to start it, rather than launching straight into the backstory. It opens with a woman in her mid-thirties, complete with ponytail of death, walking through a city market while being stalked by a shadowy monster.What I want readers to expect is that the woman is either going to be killed by the monster, or saved from it in the nick of time by the heroine. What actually happens is that when the monster finally attacks, the woman transforms into a magical girl, beats the everloving crap out of the monster, and then destroys it with a magical laser beam. Surprise! She is the heroine.I want to try and preserve this surprise as best I can, and make the readers think they're following a redshirt or one-off character instead of the protagonist. Not referring to her by name until after the reveal will help, but it's probably not enough. What else can I do to achieve this?(I'm aware of answers on other questions to the effect of "don't trick your readers". In my case, this is supposed to be a pleasant surprise, so I feel like it's okay.)

Did Amara know what she was saying to Viktoria? Early on in Pacific Rim: Uprising, after Amara first clashes with Viktoriya, one of the other cadets offers to teach Amara a few words of Russian "to help you get along with her", or something to that effect. Later on in the film, when they get into another argument, the following exchange occurs:  Amara: [in Russian] Kiss my ass.  Viktoriya: What did you say?!  Amara: [in Russian] Kiss my ass. [in English, to the other cadet] Am I saying that right?  [Viktoriya attacks her]There are two possible interpretations of this scene:Amara knew exactly what that phrase meant and was deliberately trying to rile Viktoriya up.The other cadet tricked her when he taught her that phrase, and Amara thought she was saying something that would defuse the situation. (This was my initial interpretation of the scene.)Which interpretation is correct? Was Amara knowingly telling Viktoriya to kiss her ass, or was it a misunderstanding?

What made Sakuya decide to switch sides? In Rewrite, Sakuya, Chihaya's butler, is nothing but antagonistic towards the protagonist Kotarou from the moment they first meet. He calls him insulting names and is generally just a bit of an asshole. It later turns out that both he and Chihaya are working for Gaia, the eco-terrorist group who want to destroy all human life   (and who ultimately succeed in the final episode of Season 1).Then, around Episode 8 or so, he randomly shows up in the magic forest and saves Kotarou's life. He announces he's now working with Kotarou and friends against Gaia, offers to train Kotarou, and becomes considerably less antagonistic towards him. Absolutely no explanation is given for this, and to me it seemed to come completely out of left-field.What prompted Sakuya to change sides like that so suddenly? I think Chihaya may have already defected by this point, but surely that can't be the only reason?

Then we see those moving to the finals of the competition are Suiryu and Garou.Was Suiryu or Garou who defeated Saitama in Virtual Reality?

Why Saitama was so poorly promoted after he defeated this insanely powerful enemy? So, in the battle between the Hero Association and the Monster Association,   Saitama defeated Garou.Why was he only promoted to Class A? 

Is Garou actually evil? So, Garou apparently doesn't kill his opponents.Later in the manga, he   saves a kid from monsters.And in the webcomic, Saitama says what Garou actually wanted to be is    a hero.Is Garou actually supposed to be evil?

Can Black Sperm return to be as powerful as he was? After the battle with Garou in the webcomic,   Black Sperm becomes Saitama's pet in a weakened stateCan he regrow his cells and become as powerful as he was, or all the cells he lost can't be recovered?

Which threat level is Garou? AFAIK , season 2 of One Punch Man is going to have Garou as the main villain. Which threat level is Garou according to the manga?
# Current post question:
Was Saitama sweating with worry when he saw Garou in this scene?

[rank0]:[W709 14:31:03.874827032 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Is giving child ride considered spoiling? My sister lives 15-20min walk from her school but my mom gives her a ride in the car every morning.  Is this considered spoiling the child or no.  In my opinion it is because I think it's a perfectly close enough distance to walk.

Is investing all your savings into a small number of individual stocks risky? I want to invest 90% of my savings into stock market and split between 4-6 stocks.  How risky is this and is it a bad idea.  I feel like the stock market goes up over time so unless something like 2008 depression happens again there is actually not that much risk?Note that I'm trying to turn this into a form of income and not simply getting decent returns for retirement etc.  I am okay with reasonable risk so I can work less hopefully.

bread made with egg safe to leave outside? I have some bread that has egg in it.  Safe to leave the bread at room temp after baking?  Im asking because I wouldn't leave scrambled eggs at room temp but is bread ok?

What causes a stock to make an EXTREMELY big move in a short period? Today (8/19/20) I was paper trading a stock REDU.  I was in a short position without a stop loss and stock went from 6.74 to 7.48 or over 10% in a span of less than 30 seconds, faster than I could react to get out.  Is this due to low trade volume and the bid and ask became so wide?  or someone manipulating the market?My question is how can I avoid this scenario in the future.  Would a stop loss work to get me out? or avoid these types of stocks in general.

Is there any reason to not buy if mortgage is comparable to rent? I'm curious: Say if you could buy a property or choose to rent and the mortgage per month on the property is similar to (or even lower) than the rent in your area, is there any reason to not buy?Assuming you are not looking to move and stay in the area long term.Also a follow up question, if you paid half the mortgage somewhere and want to leave, is it easy to transfer the mortgage to someone else and get what you paid so far back?

"Professional software development experience" meaning A job is asking how many years of "professional software development experience" I have. What does that mean exactly? Any software development done for a job? Or something more strict like using SDLC, git, working in a team, etc?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
First time repairing a rear wheel hub, I am hearing bearing on bearing rattle/clicks when spinning For the sake of doing a restoration I just serviced a rear wheel: new bearings, new grease, new axle and new dust caps.I think I have put enough grease. When spinning the wheel before putting it on the bike I was feeling a bit of crunchiness but no noise. After putting the wheel on, truing it, setting the brakes, I did a spin test: there is no resistance, the wheel does spin for a while with a single push. Unfortunately there is a significant metal on metal noise, feels like a bearing on bearing friction. The wheel has also a tiny bit of play but it is attached safety to the bike.Here is a video with audio: https://imgur.com/a/BTmexIYAlso, I had to replace the dust caps by a wee bit smaller ones (25mm vs 28mm), but I do not think this is to blame.

New DIY project: restoring this bike from the bins. How can I service this back wheel? I picked a broken bike from the garbage around the block. The bike has some damage. It looks like a stolen bike (spray paint awfully over original color), so it must have had some tough love. I have identified the brand and model from its parts but no one has reported it stolen, yet. It will turn into a restoration job soon.I am not the sharpest bike wrench so I could use some advice. Most parts are in good state. Obviously it needs new brake pads and new tires, and most probably a new chain, as this one is full or rust. The rear derailleur was so bent into the spokes that it broke. Definitely needs replacement by a new one.The work that needs to be done on the rear wheel is not clear to me. The spokes are unbroken but it needs truing. I found it with some of its bearings opened, the ones on the non-driving side. When looking inside: not much contamination but some of the balls seem to be missing. I already have grease. Can I just buy any balls bearings? How do I know how many I need? Also the lock ring on these bearings is crooked? See pictures. Will it close? Or do I need a new one? Is it needed to buy a new axle + bearings? Is it simpler?Here are some pictures https://imgur.com/a/UbB8NrlMany thanks.

How/where can I find replacements for these 'wheel bearing caps'? I have started the restoration of a bike picked up from the bins. The bike has taken some abuse. The rear wheel axle was broken, same for the two "bearings" caps or dust seals. I am not sure how to name these. I am providing pictures here for illustration https://imgur.com/a/fKflsyxIt was really to get a replacement for the bearings and the axle, but that cap piece - maybe because of not knowing its name - I am not able to see it for sale anywhere. I am not sure how standard or custom these pieces are. The hub has no brand or logo. The bike is a carrera zelos if this helps.

What type of bottom bracket is this (pictures)? What tools do I need to replace it? This bike has a lot of play on the bottom bracket. Here are pictures:What replacement can I buy for it? It looks like a square tapper BB to me, how do I measure which size I need? I do not have the tools to open it and read on the piece at this stage. Hence, what tools do I need to replace it?

Cannot fit in the new rain shower head I just bought a shower head from Amazon (Chinese seller I think). As soon as I received it I removed the old one and tried fitting it in. But it cannot be screwed in. The diameter seem identical to the old one with my bare eyes. But the old one screws in easily and this one stops after one turn. I tried cleaning the threads with a toothpick, adding some WD40 and it does not get any easier. Do I need a connector? How universal are the connector widths?I have added pictures.ps: It is not easy to force as the disk part can spin 360 degrees around the connector, hence I have preferred not to force for now.Link to the item I purchased if it helps: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07SSZ9RH7/

The hose reel does not rewind anymore We were using the hose to clean a patio and because we needed the whole length we pulled its full length out of the reel. It did not feel like anything clicked or broke when doing so, it was done in a fairly gentle way.The problem is that the reel does not rewind the hose anymore. There is a lever button on the side to switch locked and unlocked positions but toggling it has no effect.When trying to spin the wheel manually with the fingertips, it does not move. As if the spring is maintaining it in locked position.What can we try?Images here https://imgur.com/a/z9AZtxd

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How to care for bent avocado tree I have an avocado tree I started from a pit. It has lived in upstate New York indoors and has grown tall and skinny. I recently moved to Atlanta, Georgia and so can have it outdoors more. The tree is somewhat crooked. Should I prune it? (Possibly even cutting off the top half of the tree?)Should I get a bigger pot?Should I get some kind of system going to stabilize and/or straighten it out? Should I keep it outside all of the time?

Trees for southern Idaho/northern Utah mountain environment My goal is to find trees that would survive in the fairly harsh climate of the mountains of northern Utah/southern Idaho (near Bear Lake). Being in the mountains, it is around 7,000 feet. The trees need to be able to withstand cold temperatures of roughly -20 degrees Fahrenheit as well as be drought resistant. However, we can water them once or twice per week in the summer. What kind of trees meet the bill?We have had some success with aspen trees and some, but less, success with pine trees.

What to do with this Meyer Lemon Tree? I have a Meyer Lemon Tree that used to be doing well, but has lately been losing most of its leaves. See How to tell if indoor lemons are ready to pick for what it used to look like. I had it outside for a while, then brought it inside when it got cold. Since then, it has been not doing well. Around the time of when I brought it in, I harvested two big lemons from it. The first image shows what it looks like. The second is a closeup. There are lots of new buds---are those for lemons or for new leaves?

How to politely tell someone they did not hit "reply to all" in an email? It happens sometimes that somebody (likely) meant to reply all in an email chain, but (likely) accidentally just replied to the last person that sent the email. What is a polite way to inform them of this/ask if they actually intended to reply all?

Is there any chance for this cactus? I have this cactus cactus, but it leans heavily. The bigger it gets, the more it tends to lean. It leaned even before I repotted it, and is even worse after. Is there any saving it, or should I just get rid of it? I live in Georgia and am able to have it outside about half of the year. (I am not equipped to have indoor heat lamps or anything like that.)

How to Get Indoor Avocado Tree to Branch Out I have three indoor avocado trees that I have grown from seed (pictured). I have cut two off after they got fairly high and both have started a new branch (the one on the right has barely started its branch and the one on the left and in front has awhile ago). The one in the back I haven't cut off the stem, but I have pruned it extensively after the leaves got really big. It is now starting with some new growth at the top. I have also been picking off the leaves of the one in the front left. I don't want them to get very tall and I want them to branch out, but so far they don't like to grow leaves or branches unless it is more near the top. How can I do this? Is there any way to get the little bumps (that are present every so often up the stem) to turn into branches? How should I be pruning these trees - branches and leaves? Is what I have been doing so far completely wrong?

{  "personalized_answer": "It sounds like you might be dealing with a similar issue where the airflow is unbalanced, which can sometimes cause problems with HVAC duct connections. Given your past experiences with air flow and ventilation, it's possible that the duct not connecting properly is due to a mismatch in the dimensions or a blockage. Have you checked if the ducts are properly sized and if there are any obstructions in the return path? Also, considering your previous experience with the 3" vs 4" duct issue, you might want to ensure that the return duct is the correct size to match the fan's CFM rating. If you're still unsure, it might be helpful to consult with a professional HVAC technician who can provide a detailed inspection and ensure everything is connected and sized correctly."}

Then, consider speaking with the individual in a private, non-confrontational setting. Use "I" statements to express your concerns and observations without making accusations. For example, you could say, 'I've noticed some changes in your behavior and performance, and I'm concerned about your well-being. Have you been feeling okay?' This approach allows for an open dialogue and shows that you care about their well-being. If the issue persists or escalates, it may be necessary to involve HR or a supervisor, ensuring that the process is handled according to company policy."}

[rank0]:[W709 14:39:34.434172821 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How open should I be with my PhD supervisor about the problems in my personal life? My marriage has been going through some problems in the last year which has affected my PhD. My supervisor has been very understanding and was keen for me not to interrupt and granted me a two month extension on my upgrade paper. Last week my wife walked out. She came back but this totally put me off my studies. I was supposed to hand in a paper - an optional paper since this was for a journal submission - but I haven't even drafted it and the draft was due tomorrow.My supervisor knows I have been having marriage problems but she doesn't know any details. Also she doesn't talk about her personal life much and I don't know if she's the kind of person who would be receptive to such details, so I have so far withheld them. Should I tell her my wife walked out? At the moment I have just said there was an incident. She also knows that I have been diagnosed with symptoms of moderate/severe depression, but I thought it best that she knew this since it could affect my work.Should I carry on being vague or should I test the water and treat her like an intelligent adult and give her more context and details of my issues? Or should I just keep the personal stuff as separate as possible?

My PhD seems daunting and overbearing. How shall I regain motivation and interest? EDIT: I should clarify this is not the first draft of my PhD, it's the first draft of my upgrade document to go from MPhil to PhD.I have been working on my PhD for about two years now, it is a six year part-time program. I have a very good relationship with all my supervisors and they are very supportive. I am fortunate to be part of a good university which is open-minded and free-thinking. I also have attracted the interest of a well-known external academic who is an authority within the field and who wants to be involved. I am very lucky.The problem is that I am just not that interested or convinced by my research [chiefly its significance]. I have to submit my upgrade document [MPhil > PhD] in about five week's time, and the viva is a week after that. I have written a draft document which is 12,000 words and my main supervisor has written a lot of comments which are suggestions for improvements. The issue is that I do not feel that interested or compelled to work through them. I am under the impression that my supervisor is not that convinced by my research, even though she keeps saying she has no concerns. I feel my research is too vague, too broad but also too overbearing. It incorporates three disciplines [at the advice of one of my supervisors], disciplines A B and C. Discipline A I am not that interested in - I was for my master's but now I find it quite tedious but it is quite an important part of the whole. It is a well-worn discipline and feels rather old and stale to me now. Discipline B is quite new and interesting, I have published within this discipline. Disipline C is very new and up-and-coming. I find it quite exciting and my supervisor has written the least amount of comments about it in my draft paper, which I take to mean she has the least amount of complaints about it [she has a lot of comments to make about dispclines A/B]. She has also said that discpline C is a 'key' part of the PhD. I do not know what to do. I am really not that interested and the whole thing seems so daunting. My PhD focuses on A and B mostly with C being only a feature, but I am wondering whether I should switch things round entirely and make it more about C. I feel I will not really be able to convince my panel about the significance of my research in the viva if I am not excited about it or convinced myself. In my master's I was always keen to research and write, now I am not, but I know I would be if the topic were carried out a bit differently. What shall I do, how shall I regain interest? My PhD seems rather fluffy and not sharp enough. Additionally, I am daunted by the scope of the whole thing: it seems too large to work through and 'bigger' than me. I am kind of at a loss for what to do.

Should I talk to my supervisor about including a new field in my PhD? I am a part-time PhD student coming towards the end of my first year – I have another five years left. My PhD is in Music and I do like my topic a lot. However, in the last 18 months I have also become very interested in an area that is not that related to music – computing and open source. I started looking at it as something extra to learn before my PhD started and am now finding it difficult to put down. As well as this, I would like to integrate some aspects of what I have learned into my PhD. I just don't really know what and how. Is this something that I should bring up with my PhD supervisor or should I just "put up or shut up"? She may think it's a bit weird to mention it since she will probably feel that it doesn't really relate, however, computing (and its related ethics) are fundamental to the ways in which we undertake academic research these days. We've even had a few classes on software use. I feel that I could probably link the two in some way but little has come up yet which is obvious, though it may well present itself in the future. From past experience I tend to function at my academic best when integrating different challenging interests into my learning and I would love to integrate my learning of computing into my music PhD. I feel I have learned – and applied – a lot and I want to continue learning alongside my music learning and to combine the two in my topic. Question: should I raise this with my supervisor, float some ideas past her about this or should I just ignore it? If I do the latter the question may well come back to haunt me further down the line. I don't think I "can" (nor do I want to) give this up, well, not without forcing myself to since it fascinates me. Do others have experience of wanting to mix in new ideas/subjects into their PhDs and how did you go about it?For clarification - the PhD in Music is ethnomusicological, i.e. the PhD is to do with the study of music in culture and as culture rather than composition or performance.

Is there a preferable time of year when one should apply for a PhD in the UK? [Edited] I am very shortly going to be sending off my PhD application. I cannot apply quite yet because I am waiting on my bachelor's documentation which was withheld (library fines which are now cleared) but now it is in processing, and I do have my transcript. I have my master's documentation. The BA uni say they don't know when the cert will be ready, it could be a week or two, or longer presumably. The deadlines for PhD applications are set as the summer, but I know that many faculties like to have the applications in sooner because they want to decide on their student quantities. Is there some kind of unspoken deadline that I should shoot for in general [e.g. late Feb, Apr etc] or does it vary by institution? Does one lessen one's chances of acceptance if applying nearer to the official early summer deadlines?I should mention that a staff member in my choice of PhD uni has already approved my proposal and agreed to be my supervisor. Should I apply anyway without the BA cert and just say it is in processing [without going into reasons why]? I am not applying for funding.

How long should one wait for a reference before writing to the course convenor? I am getting a little worried about my PhD application. I submitted it three weeks ago with reference requests going out to Prof A and B. Prof B wrote to me the same evening to say it would be done asap, and Prof A didn't respond, but that's fine. Three weeks later and Prof A has written back and completed the reference, though nothing so far from B. I have written to B with a polite reminder but they haven't written back. How long do people take on average to get these things across and should I be concerned? I know these academics are very busy but at the same time this is the only thing holding the application up. Should I write to the convenor about my concern if this goes on for a couple more weeks? What other ways could I politely encourage a response?

Should I structure my CV in sections for relevant experience to PhD and day job work if the two are unrelated? I am applying for my PhD currently [in Music]. Part of the application concerns sending a CV. When I applied for my master's I just sent them my normal work CV [which had nothing to do with music] and that seemed to do the job to get the application through. However, I have done many music-related things over the years [A&R, promotion, journalism etc] and have constructed a CV around these for my new application as 'relevant experience' to the PhD. Should I include another section for my day job[s] as well [which have nothing to do with music] or should I just keep to relevant to the academic application?

Letting students grade their own homework I am going to teach a course in algorithms to 2nd-year undergraduates. The grade in this course is composed of 90% exam and 10% homework. The problem is, this year we do not have enough personnel to grade the homework. Theoretically, it may be possible to change the grade struture and make it 100% based on final exam, but, this will reduce the incentive of students to study and practice during the semester, which I think will harm their learning experience.So, I thought of the following scheme: the students will have to submit each assignment before the next TA session. The TA will explain the solutions during the session, and then each student will grade his/her own homework.Sure, some students might be tempted to give themselves 100 on all assignments, but I believe this will not be very harmful since:All assignments together compose only 10% of the grade, so every single assignment is less than 1%. Even if many students get 10% for free, the final exam is still sufficient to differentiate the good from the bad students. The group consists of excellent students (the top 20%, based on their 1st year mean grade). I believe most of them want to succeed in the exam, so they will take this as an opportunity to track their own progress during the course, rather than an opportunity to just get some points for free.What do you think about this scheme? 

Grades are too high for the department - what should I do? I recently taught an undergraduate seminar course, in which each student has to read a research paper, summarize it and present it to the class. In the first lesson I explained to the students the components of the grade: attendance, summary writing, and presentation quality. Most of the students did great jobs: attendance was near full, summaries were good, and presentations were great. Many of them did more than I expected - they contacted the paper's authors to get more information, presented movies and demos, engaged the class in discussions, etc. So, when I wrote the grades to myself, most of them were between 90 and 100. But then, when I told this to the department vice-chair, he told me "what have you done? You will cause a grade-inflation! The department policy is that the average grade on seminar courses should be at most 85!"I totally understand this policy - grades that are too high might show that the course was too easy, and they do not sufficiently distinguish between good and better students. Also, they might be unfair to students who took the course in previous years.However, I am not sure what I should do now. I haven't published the grades to the students yet. Should I just re-scale the grades so that 90 becomes 70? I feel this is somewhat unfair to the students who worked hard for their presentations. Are there better options?

What to do if most of my students have switched to a better lecturer's class? I teach a certain course which is part of the obligatory undergraduate curriculum. I teach two groups out of four; the other two groups are taught by two other lecturers. In one group I have about 20-30 students. The other group also started with the same number, but students left the group gradually, and now there remain only 5 or even less; the others go to the other lecturer who gives the same lesson in parallel. One reason is probably that I am a new teacher and still not very good at teaching. Another reason is that the other lecturer is very good. I feel that some of the 5 students remaining in my class do so only because they are being polite. I appreciate it very much since I put a lot of effort in preparing the lessons, but it is not very efficient for me or for them. So, I thought of suggesting to the remaining students that they move to the other lecturer's group. This way, they will have a better lecturer and I will have more time for research  (the other lecturer said it's OK with him). What might be the implications of such a step? UPDATE: Thanks a lot for all the feedback. While there are many great answers, the one thing that convinced me to keep going was the fact that this is the only way I can become a better teacher. So today I came to class as usual. For some reason, the number of students rised to 10.

How can I politely decline to guide a student? I am a lecturer in a department in which undergraduate students have to do a final-year project guided (= supervised) by a faculty member. Faculty members do not have to guide students: those who do, get extra payment for this.Most students who want me to be their guide are great and I am happy to guide them, but a few of them - I suspect - will be very "not fun" to work with: when they took a course of mine previously, they argued a lot about their grade, complained a lot about the course rules, etc. They made me spent a lot of time and energy on futile arguments rather than on productive teaching. I do not want to guide these students - I feel it will be a waste of my time and energy, not worth the extra payment.However, if I just tell them bluntly "I do not want to guide you since I do not like you", they will be very insulted.I cannot filter them out based on their grades, since their grades are similar to the average.I could say that "I am too busy to guide you", which is true, but I am not too busy to guide other students, and the student will probably find this out.How can I politely reject their request without insulting them?

Should I prepare new homework exercises each year, 20% of the final grade is homework? This year I prepare a new course (in programming, but it could be any other course). I spend a lot of effort in creating homework exercises. This is fun, but also very time-consuming.I wonder if I can use the same exercises next year, when I teach this course again. The main problem is that, once the solutions are out, surely some students next year will be able to get them and copy them. It may be possible to use some automatic plagiarism detection tools, but it is quite difficult and not very reliable.I believe the copiers will not gain much from copying, since the homework grade is only 20% of the final grade. On the contrary, they will lose since they will be less prepared for the exam, which is 80% of the final grade. My fear is that the temptation to copy will harm these students. So maybe I should create new exercises to avoid the temptation to copy.On the other hand, the students are grown-ups, if they choose to copy, it is their problem and they should bear the consequences of not knowing the material well enough. Should I work so hard each year, only to protect the copiers from their own faults?

Should I include teaching feedback from students in my CV? Some time ago, I worked as a teaching assistant in a college. That college had an online form for collecting student feedback. After the end of the year, they sent me an official letter with my final "teaching grade" and the verbal feedback, both of which are very good.Now, I am near the end of my Ph.D. and I am working on my CV. Should I include this feedback? I thought of including it in the end, after the "recommendations" section, since these are officially-documented recommendations from past students. Is this a good idea?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
What to do if ellipses are already in a text What should I do to let a reader know that in a quote the ellipses aren't mine and have been placed by the original author? This is the quote:  My home university did a study of its alumni a few years back, and they discovered that out of all the various degree subjects, the one that led to the highest average income was ... mathematics. (Stewart, Letters, 1)

What is the axiological basis of the preference of truth to falsity? Axiologically speaking, why is truth the preferred logical value by humans? In general, why do we prefer true statements to false ones? What about the value of true makes a statement "right," while false is "wrong?" Specifically, why do true statements seem to be valued higher than false statements and why does our day-to-day language seem to favor factual statements?

Why are true and false the only truth values used in mathematics? Why do we use only true and false? It is possible to have many states in-between in fuzzy logic and other many-valued logics. If we assign numbers to true and false, such as 1 and 0 respectively, what would be the logical interpreation of -1, i, j or k (with i,j,k as defined for quaternions)?  Is there any reason for this dichotomy? What type of statement would have these truth values if such a statement existed?

What punctuation should I use with a quote like this? I have this sentence:  Executive order 9066 allowed "the Secretary of War and the Military Commanders ... to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may impose."My question is should a comma go before this quote? Or should I use a colon? Or does this quote not need punctuation before it? And why?

Does the Bible ever mention class systems? Does the Bible ever talk about class systems? If so what does it say about them? Does it give a recommended class hierarchy at any point? Would a classless society be allowed?See also this question at politics se (there are links to more questions at other religious sites there).

Tofu as a growing medium? I just had a strange idea of no actual significance, but I was just staring at a block of tofu and wondered if you could plant things in it. Has anyone tried this? How does/would tofu fair as a growing medium. How would plants grow differently in hard, medium, and soft tofu?

On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Writing rule which states that two causes for the same superpower is bad writing I've read somewhere that there is this writing rule stating that, for some superpower, it would be less believable if two completely different settings are present in order to obtain the same superpower. In the article, I remember it mentioned in the movie Spiderman (which I've not watched), the protagonist and another character gain the power through different means.What's this rule and does it have a name?

Is 'Sold Count' a good term I am writing a technical document, and in it I want to refer to the number of units sold for each product. I want to make it concise, and 'sold count' comes to mind. Does this term sound right? Are there better alternatives?

Exercise with pulmonary stenosis I have mild congenital pulmonary stenosis, which Wikipedia defines as:  outflow of blood from the right ventricle of the heart is obstructed  at the level of the pulmonic valve. This results in the reduction of  flow of blood to the lungs.It doesn't affect me at all in my daily life. Recently I thought I should start regular exercises, so I try to jog from time to time. What I want to ask are:How to tell if I am just using that as an excuse or am I really at my limit? My jogging habits are always run a little, walk a little, run a little, walk a little. I guess I switch when I am slightly out of breath.I understand these are more medical related, but none of the doctors I have visited can tell me anything in depth.Is there a particular type of exercises that are good for people like me?Would weight training be related to this at all?

Can I sleep on a airplane tray table?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How to trick the reader into thinking they're following a redshirt instead of the protagonist? I'm currently planning a "magical girl" story, and I thought of an interesting way to start it, rather than launching straight into the backstory. It opens with a woman in her mid-thirties, complete with ponytail of death, walking through a city market while being stalked by a shadowy monster.What I want readers to expect is that the woman is either going to be killed by the monster, or saved from it in the nick of time by the heroine. What actually happens is that when the monster finally attacks, the woman transforms into a magical girl, beats the everloving crap out of the monster, and then destroys it with a magical laser beam. Surprise! She is the heroine.I want to try and preserve this surprise as best I can, and make the readers think they're following a redshirt or one-off character instead of the protagonist. Not referring to her by name until after the reveal will help, but it's probably not enough. What else can I do to achieve this?(I'm aware of answers on other questions to the effect of "don't trick your readers". In my case, this is supposed to be a pleasant surprise, so I feel like it's okay.)

How should my script refer to a character who's currently disguised as another character? I've recently resumed writing a series of scripts for an anime I've been planning. One of the characters has the ability to shape-shift, and there are several scenes in which she initially appears disguised as another character, before shape-shifting back into her normal self.So far, when writing these scenes, I've referred to the character using the name of the person she's disguised as, and only switched back to her real name after she transforms back again. However, the top answers to these questions suggest that I shouldn't do that; scripts are production documents, and it's imperative that the crew know exactly who's supposed to be in each scene, hence I should always refer to characters by their real names.But in the case of a character who's disguised as another character, how do I do this while also making it clear that they're pretending to be someone else right now?

How to avoid constantly starting paragraphs with "The character did this" "The character did that"? This is one of the tics I've noticed in my writing recently, and it's starting to bug me. Almost every single one of my paragraphs, particularly during dialogue sequences, starts with "The character did this". The main exceptions are when I use "'Quote', attribution, 'continuance'" instead.Here's a brief example:"I'll come visit you every now and again, if I'm not too busy," said Electron.Colin smiled. "I'm sure the other patients will appreciate that as well," he said. "You been to the children's ward yet?""Not yet," said Electron. "I think I'll leave that for last. The kids won't want me to go, you know?"Colin nodded. "You're a good man, Electron," he said. "I think we're gonna get along just fine. It's a pleasure to have you in my city."Electron returned the mayor's smile. "It's a pleasure to be here," he said.How do I get out of this habit? Or is this not worth worrying about?

Protagonist constantly has to have long words explained to her. Will this get tedious? A while back, I redrafted my NaNoWriMo 2017 story, but it still needs another draft. This question is about one of the concerns I have.The story takes place in a medieval fantasy setting, and the protagonist is a homeless orphan of about fourteen. As a result, she has a somewhat limited education, and at various points has to have long or complex words explained to her. At first I inserted these moments in order to underscore her limited education, but I kept on inserting them in order to pad things out just that little bit more.An example: the villain, whose thieves' guild the protagonist has infiltrated, is describing their master plan, and refers to a "network of clandestine tunnels" under the city. The protagonist's partner notices her confusion, leans over, and whispers, "'Clandestine' means 'secret'".I don't have access to the full draft right now, but off the top of my head, this happens at least six times in the space of 41,000 words, including once during what's supposed to be a very dramatic and emotional climax. I'm worrying that this is too frequent, and that it might get tedious or distract from the story somewhat. Will it? Or am I overthinking it?

How do I write transitions between thinking and speaking? I've just downloaded an open-source script-writing program, and have started converting the scripts for an anime I've been writing into industry-standard formatting.There are a few points in the scripts where a character says something out loud, then immediately thinks something else (which the audience hears in voiceover), or thinks something and then says something else out loud. In my (not-at-all industry-formatted) scripts, I've indicated these like so:  CHARACTER: Follow me, and stay quiet. We'll be out of here shortly. (in thought) I hope.Or:  CHARACTER: (in thought) This isn't good. (out loud) Guys, we need to get out of here now--I already know that I need to change "(in thought)" to "(V.O.)", but other than that, how do I convert these into industry-standard formatting?

Under what circumstances were F1 teams allowed to re-use old chassis built by other teams? It used to be the case that new F1 teams could re-use outdated chassis designs built by other teams, however I'm confused about the circumstances under which they could do so.In 1992, Andrea Moda were not allowed to use an updated version of the Coloni C4 chassis from 1991.In 2006, Toro Rosso were allowed to use an updated version of the Red Bull RBR1 chassis from 2005.That same year, Super Aguri were not allowed to use an updated version of the BAR 007 from 2005, but they were allowed to use an updated version of the Arrows A23 from 2002.To me, there doesn't seem to be any consistency to these decisions.What exactly were the rules governing whether new teams could re-use existing chassis designs? Were there specific circumstances in which teams could or could not use them, which would explain the situations outlined above? Or it was arbitrary and determined on a case-by-case basis?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
are what we translate as "adjectives", "nouns", etc, the same kind of words in no indo-european languages? This question comes from questions in japanese SE. Keiyōshi 形容詞 are translated as adjectives. Meishi 名詞 are translated as nouns. But are they really the same kind of words that we mean with nouns, adjectives, etc. in English? I've already found 3 examples that arises a lot of doubts in me if they are the same thing. The first is a japanese word that I can't remember right now but that I've seen used as a noun, adjective or verb. May be there are words like these in English or Spanish, but I'm not sure if they are the same. For example the word paddle can be a verb, a noun or an adjective in English. The second is japanese words that they see as a noun and that we see as adjectives. The word "next" for japaneses is a clear noun. They know that it can be used as an adjective, but when giving an example of when it is used as a noun (what it really is according to japanese), I got this "when is the next?" that is a sentence that could come in a conversation between 2 persons about events , and one of them ask the other "when is the next (event)?" . wouldnt it be for english speakers, still an adjective because it modifies an implicit noun (event)? And the third is the word "suki" and similar words, that they see as a verb and it's translated as "to like" but it is used next to the verb desu (to be) So my question is, are what we translate as adjectives, verbs, etc, from other non indoeuropean languages, really what we understand as verbs, adjectives, etc?

Did Maradona ever score a goal with his right foot? I was hearing one of Pele's declaration stating Maradona couldn't score goals with his right foot. I thought he was talking in general, but then I started to think about goals made by him with his right foot and I couldn't remember any. I made a little research about this and I couldn't find any goal scored by him with his right foot, even though I clearly didn't watch all 300+ goals he made in his career (I'm not sure if all of them were recorded on TV by the way).I also remembered he used to kick the ball to the center of the field with his left foot even when he was in the right side of the field, giving the pass with a "Rabona" instead of with his right foot, because he was too much of a left-footed player. So, did he ever score a goal with his right foot, or did he never score one this way?

Which are the canonical sources for reading about Isa in Islam? Once I've read that Islam says Isa is going to return to Earth and fight a war. This is a different version of character personality that's given for Jesus in christianity were he says "Put your sword back in its place. for all who draw the sword will die by the sword". (I suppose Islam doesnt see the source where is quoted him saying that as a true source since it seems to be contradictory with someone later returning to fight a war) . I'm interested to read more about him in Islam to see how different they are portraited 

Did the italian parliament deny what mayor of Alzano Lombardo say about people in his city not being hospitalized because hospitals are full? There is a report from Italy in many webpage which says  "There are many elderly people at home with breathing difficulties.  They are not hospitalized because the hospitals are full" said the  mayor of Alzano Lombardo Carmelo BertocchiCoronavirus updateSome italians in forums say this is an hoax and one said the italian parliament denied this. Is there any record of the italian parliament denying this statement by Alzano Lombardo mayor?

Is Coronavirus transmission affected by the season of the host country / hemisphere? First when the Coronavirus outbreak happened in China, some people argued that the outbreak had to do with a supposed faulty chinese health care system, due to China not being a "developed country". But now in South Korea and Italy, supposed "developed countries" the cases are increasing even at over a 100% rate per day some days. Now in Italy the first cases appeared apparently in 31 January and in South Korea apparently in 20 January. So in 3 / 4 weeks those countries jumped from  units to hundreds / over a thousand cases. Yet in another "developed country" like Australia, the first case was reported 25 January , but the country was able to keep the number of cases below / in 23 for a month. Can be a factor contributing to the outbreaks in South Korea / Italy the fact that they are in the northern hemisphere / winter , and that Australia is in the southern hemisphere / summer by February? Could an outbreak as fast as those which happened in South Korea / Italy happen in a country which is in summer by the time it happens?

Is there any language where each character is pronounced differently depending on the word it's in? Languages like Japanese have different pronunciations for each character (in the kanji system in this case) , a kanji character can have up to 20 different pronunciations depending on the the word it is in. Is there or was there any language where each character is pronounced differently depending on the word it's in?

On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Is investing all your savings into a small number of individual stocks risky? I want to invest 90% of my savings into stock market and split between 4-6 stocks.  How risky is this and is it a bad idea.  I feel like the stock market goes up over time so unless something like 2008 depression happens again there is actually not that much risk?Note that I'm trying to turn this into a form of income and not simply getting decent returns for retirement etc.  I am okay with reasonable risk so I can work less hopefully.

What causes a stock to make an EXTREMELY big move in a short period? Today (8/19/20) I was paper trading a stock REDU.  I was in a short position without a stop loss and stock went from 6.74 to 7.48 or over 10% in a span of less than 30 seconds, faster than I could react to get out.  Is this due to low trade volume and the bid and ask became so wide?  or someone manipulating the market?My question is how can I avoid this scenario in the future.  Would a stop loss work to get me out? or avoid these types of stocks in general.

Is there any reason to not buy if mortgage is comparable to rent? I'm curious: Say if you could buy a property or choose to rent and the mortgage per month on the property is similar to (or even lower) than the rent in your area, is there any reason to not buy?Assuming you are not looking to move and stay in the area long term.Also a follow up question, if you paid half the mortgage somewhere and want to leave, is it easy to transfer the mortgage to someone else and get what you paid so far back?

limiting losses when shorting stock First time shorting stock just want to make sure I limit my losses correctly.  Say I short 100 shares of SPY and $272 and I  want to get out(cover my short) if it goes above $285 would the following sequence be right?Initiate transaction Action:SELL SHORT 100 shares of SPY.Initiate second transaction Action: BUY Type:STOP 100 shares SPY at $285 stop price.

Live off of $100k in savings for as long as possible What is the best way to live off of a set amount e.g. $100k - $150k in savings with no income? Assuming you can relocate to anywhere in the US with low cost of living, can you live off of this for 20+ years?

Is margin interest applied to intraday trades? I'm trying to understand how the margin interest charge is calculated when you borrow money from a broker like Fidelity to buy stocks for  intraday trades. If the rate is 8% then is the daily charge should be 8% / 365 or 0.0219% of how much you borrowed?  Or if you buy and then sell the stock on the same day  then the   broker does not charge you any interest?

How to tackle the bibliographic work as an entering PhD student? I'll be starting my PhD in the next fall. I already looked over the internet for advice for a beginner, even read two books on the subjects. Still, there is one point I haven't seen discussed as I wanted, it's the time and the way the student should be investing in catching up on his field and his specific topic, I'm speaking about the bibliographic part. For sure a student needs a lot of (continuous) input, but at the end he'll be solely judged on his output. From my previous research project, I'm not really confident in my way of balancing between going through articles/textbook material and trying to solve my own problematics. To be honest, it sometimes feels like a sneaky way of procrastinating: I'd tell myself that I'm still not ready to tackle my problem and that I need to make a little "detour" by existing works; and when it's done I don't feel more at ease to answer my questions. Or is it a normal aspect of research?In my specific case, I'll be working on a quite new subject (string theory) when I only had advanced lecture of quantum field theory and general relativity; so I'm thinking about going through the canonical textbook on the subject during the summer, do most of the exercises and derivations in there (which already represents hundreds of hours invested), maybe revising some mathematical tools I need to be really familiar with. Once I'll have a general idea of the topic I'll jump to the main articles in relation to my thesis. I also know that I will be using numerical tools (Monte Carlo methods) and will need to get conformable with that. So far I only have a superficial knowledge and use of the tool.Does it seem like a good use of my time? I already know that time and willpower are limited resources in grad school and I really don't want my desire to do well to burn me out from the beginning.

Why does the minor pentatonic scale sounds "oriental" to me? I've been training my minor pentatonic scale on guitar for a while (mostly playing it in A with the first position) and it always sounded somewhat oriental to me, in the sense of the musical airs you'd find in music to set the plot in Orient, musical clichés. I am not sure to be really clear in trying to share this impression, but I, then, read that in Orient they used to split the octave in 5 tones, and not 7 as we did in Europe, would it be because the pentatonic as only five notes (by definition) that my sub

Looking for advice on my self-taught music education Until a year ago, I had absolutely no music education, and I decided to change that around this period, well more exactly I picked up on (acoustic) guitar as a hobby and from there gained interest in knowing more about music. And so I discovered some theory: scales, chords, keys, harmony, melody and rhythm on websites and in some books. I also followed Wright lectures "Listening to music" http://oyc.yale.edu/ and read the first chapters of his book on this course (or vice-versa). I've gained knowledge but I'm not sure about the next steps, should I try applying it on my guitar ans starting to transcribe/compose? Listen the most to the broadest set of music genres? Start focusing on one? I'm a bit lost in my learning path, and would be glad to hear some suggestions.

How can I increase my focus and pleasure in reading English? After working on my oral skills in English for a couple of years, I know more interested in learning written English, specially by reading. I have been reading a couple of books over the last months (Game of Thrones, the whole Sherlock Holmes, Lord of the Rings, some Stephen King...) and articles (the Guardian, the New York Times, the Atlantic, mostly). But although I've felt some improvements in my understanding, and learned lots of words, I'm still not enjoying reading English as much as I do enjoy reading French (which is my natural language), and I'm not even what you could call a literary (checking my other stackexchange affiliations would prove you that...). When reading English I just follow the plot, but I'm really totally insensitive in the style of writing, in the choice of words, ... I hardly realized that when reading a few pages of French the other day, it's even way easier to focus on what I read when it is French than English.Fellow who learned English as a second (or third, or more...) language, have already felt that? Have you been through that? How long did it take? Or is it just a never ending job in progress but I'll never reach the ease I have with French?

How to improve finger style guitar playing I am a competent, but not amazing, guitar player who is very comfortable with the usual chords as well as basic fingerpicking patterns. I would like to take it to the next level and be able to improvise and play something along the lines of (though not initially as complicated as) this by James Taylor: 
                
             - starting at about 2:40. Another example of something that I would love to do is 
                
            . As opposed to learning a particular song, which is fine, I am more interested in learning general techniques that I can improvise with when I am playing around on the guitar.What resources/tutorials/lessons would you recommend that can help me play interesting things like in these videos? 

What does "her mama leaned hard" in this Emmylou Harris Song mean? I was listening to the song "Red Dirt Girl" by Emmylou Harris, and didn't understand one of the lyrics: "her mama leaned hard." What does this mean?Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hardGot in trouble with a boy from townI did find one definition from this blog, but it doesn't seem to be what I am looking for: "To lean hard you must get under God’s feet and submit to His plans and purposes, even if you do not see them fully or understand them at all. Leaning means shifting all the weight of the burden from your shoulders to His."

How to gracefully walk away from coauthored paper I am working on a coauthored paper which I would like to step away from. How can I do so very tactfully and gracefully? I want to step away because I don't quite agree with the direction the paper is taking in terms of analysis; the publication prospects are not terrific; and, frankly, I am not sure if I fully believe the results (our setting is not very "clean," meaning that there are several alternative explanations). I don't necessarily want to say all of these things to them.Another detail is that the coauthors are two people at my current institution. I am going to be transitioning to another institution (in another state) in the next few months. Note this is not one of my main reasons to walk away, but being away will make it somewhat harder to collaborate. It will also be nice to get this off my plate so I can focus more on other projects.

Fungible Money Question Suppose that there are two people, A and B.  Each has a physical dollar bill.  Each donates the dollar bill to an organization.  The organization buys something for a dollar.First suppose that the organization buys the something with one of the two physical dollar bills.  If A claims that his money bought the item, then he may or may not be correct.  This is analogous for B.  All you would have to do is check the dollar and figure out who it originally came from.However, suppose that the bank deposits the money into an online bank account.  Then the money is truly fungible.  If A claims that the organization bought something with his money, how would we evaluate this claim?  Does it even make any sense for A to make this claim?  What if B also makes the claim?

Data Source for 2012 US Congress and US Senate Elections I need to find a good data source for the 2012 United States Congress and Senate elections.  I have found this: http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2012/federalelections2012.shtml  The problem is that it is in a not-so-user-friendly format in Excel.  And an even harder-to-use format in PDF.I have found the State Legislative returns in a good format at http://www.indstate.edu/polisci/klarnerpolitics.htm.  I would ideally have the same thing as this.Any kind of CSV, Stata, etc. would be fantastic.Any tips on where I should look?

Expand Bass Guitar Playing Beyond Root Notes I am fairly new to the bass guitar and I'm in a band.  So far, I almost always just play the root note of the chord.  I sometimes hold it until a new chord and sometimes repeatedly play this same note.The root notes I commonly play are C, D, B, F#, E, etc.   For example, a song may be D G Bm A. What I am doing is fine, but I feel like it would be great to branch out and play things besides just the root.  How should I go about this?  What are examples?

{  "personalized_answer": "It sounds like you're looking for a specific type of outdoor vent for your furnace, similar to how you were curious about different systems and processes in the past. For your current question, the type of outdoor vent you need will depend on your specific furnace model and local building codes. Generally, there are two main types: direct-vent and power-vent. Direct-vent systems draw air from outside for combustion and exhaust gases back outside, while power-vent systems use a fan to exhaust gases. Given your interest in understanding different systems and processes, I recommend checking the manufacturer's specifications for your furnace and consulting with a professional to ensure you choose the right vent for your setup. This will help prevent any issues, much like how careful planning was important for the "butterfly ballot" and other systems you've inquired about in the past."}

If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Shall I ask my agency to overturn negative client feedback? I work for a writing agency. A few days ago, a client asked us to do some work for his website. The client said it was 'proofreading'. I did the work, the agency approved it. It was sent to the client for final approval.The client wrote back to say that what he actually wanted was his text rewritten so the site sold better. I wrote back to the agency to say this pretty much constituted a new job. The agency agreed so I got on with the work.I resubmitted and the agency approved it - again! It was sent to the client for final approval. I waited a few days and the client rejected it. He wrote back to say that the work was low quality and he could have done a better job himself. My agency were very nice about it, I got paid regardless, but it left a blemish on my stats, it's the first time a client has rejected a piece of my work.I am considering writing to my agency and asking them to overturn the negative feedback because1 - the client was vague about what they wanted - and in the first place, they described what they wanted incorrectly;2 - it was a new client, so we had no previous examples of what the client liked to work from3 - it's clear that the client had something very specific in mind, but they were not able to articulate their needs or show us the kind of thing they had in mind.I kept to the description as much as I could - short, concise, selling the site, a bit humorous. There was nothing I could do save getting inside the client's head. Because of this one negative piece of feedback I am now nearly halfway down my agency's ladder of writers, whereas before I was at the top.Should I write to my agency about this or just swallow it? I could do the latter, but I still feel an injustice is being done somewhere. 

Article I wrote has been published under another name - should I raise this with the publisher? I do part-time copywriting work and over the weekend I wrote a ~1500 word paid article for an online publication. It was a lot of research and toil, I had half a day to do it and I finally submitted the thing at 2am on Sunday. It was a very tricky piece.Now I notice the article has been published, with some minor edits, but under a different name. The client has used one of their own employees as the author. I wasn't aware that I was ghostwriting. Should I raise this with the publisher? Should credit not be given where it is due - or should I remain quiet unless I irritate them? I'm quite new to this but should they not at least have said it would be credited to someone else?

Should I include the name[s] of copywriting agencies I write for on my CV? I'm a startup copywriter, and some agencies request a CV on application to join. Should I include the name[s] of some of the agencies I already work with and which send me jobs?

Client has asked for a piece to be rewritten after agency acceptance of my submission. How much should I charge? Yesterday I was given a job which was to proofread a website and make any changes "where necessary". That's all the brief said. I did so, amended any typos etc, changed some grammar and spiced it up here and there. I submitted my piece and my agency accepted it, meaning I get paid. Great.I am a freelance copywriter. Today I get a message saying that the client says there was a "misunderstanding". He says he wants the text rewritten in a way that sells the site more, not just changed here and there. Clearly my agency thought I had fulfilled his brief, because they accepted my submission, but he is saying he wants the thing basically rewritten from scratch as I understand it.How much do I charge for this revision? I will be paid X for my original submission. But should I charge X again, because this sounds like a new job, half of X or less? I love my agency and don't want to annoy them, but it seems that the client's original brief was really vague. I am unsure of what to do.

Should one use first or third person terminology when discussing one's character? This is not about viewing the character, but how to refer to them verbally in conversation. On these and other boards I see plenty of people using both first and third person terminology, e.g. "I did this" vs "my character did this"; or "my character prefers magic over weaponry" rather than "I prefer magic over weaponry" in the context of the game. Speaking in the third person makes it seem like the character is an independent entity, which they clearly are not since their existence depends on that of the player.I find this confusing. Sometimes the player will make the character do things the player would not do in real life in such a situation, but then, it is still the player making those choices. My player is female but I am male, I still refer to her as "I" - is this not correct [by "correct" I mean whatever is considered normal practice]?I am tagging this question with Skyrim, because, unlike with, e.g The Witcher, the player creates the character from the ground up [I am sure there are many other games when the player has to do the same but I don't know what they are].

Winstad Manor: Will my firepit go if I change my small house to an entryway? I just bought Hearthfire in Oldrim and was very keen to get going with building Windstad Manor. I should have focused on the main house construction rather than the furnishings and I put a firepit and cooking pot in the small house which will become the entrance.Now I realise that when I extend the house I won't want this firepit there. When I convert this small house to an entryway, will the firepit/cooking pot disappear? I would prefer this. In the future I will just focus on construction of the main areas rather than any interior furnishings.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Grades vs. projects in job application I am teaching computer science undergraduates, who will most likely go to work in the software industry. They often ask me for career advice and I want to know what advice to give them. Specifically, suppose a student can choose between two elective courses:Course A has a relatively low average grade (60-70/100), but during the homework assignments, the students build an industry-level project.Course B has a relatively high average grade (80-90/100), the homework assignments are simple and not industry-level.On one hand, course A lowers the student's average grade, so there is more chance the student will be filtered out based on a low average, even before the interview.On the other hand, if the student does get to the interview stage, having a strong project to show is a big advantage.I know that each work-place is different, but I would still be happy if there is a general rule-of-thumb to help the student decide: what is more helpful for getting a job in the software industry - a high average grade, or a strong project?

Pandemic - reduced rule-set for beginners I have recently started playing pandemic, and was overwhelmed by the amount of rules.Is there a reduced set of rules, easier to learn and remember but still fun, that can be used by beginners until they get used to the game?EDIT: My goal is not to make the game easier to win - it is to make the game easier to learn how to play. Instead of learning all rules at once, the team can learn the rules one by one. For example, suppose there are 10 rules (just an arbitrary number). Then instead of remembering all these rules at once, we can start with 5 rules, then add a new rule each play, until we remember and play by all rules.

How can I convert a linear narrative into a branching narrative? Suppose I would like to create a text adventure game, but my imagination is not sufficient for creating a whole game. But there are fiction books (in the public domain) that are very imaginative and could potentially make a great game. The main problem is that, a standard fiction book is sequential, while in a game there are many branches. Even if I have, say, only 10 branches, I still have to write 9 of these on my own.Is there a process that can make this easier? A structured procedure by which I can work, that can help me convert a novel to a text adventure, with minimal need to use my "rusty" imagination?I looked around the web and found some links that apparently discuss this topic, but with few details:Five tips for turning a book into an interactive game - mainly discusses what should be in a book in order to be able to make a game out of it, namely: scalability, strong characters, first-person narrative, and genre. But, it does not speak about the conversion process itself.What the heck is interactive fiction? - a subsection titled "Converting Fiction to IF" gives some hints: pick a shorter story, think about the choices your character makes, think how to display text on the page, think outside the page. Again, few details about the process itself are given.EDIT: thanks a lot to all the repliers for the wonderful ideas and the warm welcome!

Ice-cream-on-a-stick in refrigerator temperature In the summer, I used to make ice-cream-on-a-stick in various flavors. Some examples:Chocolate flavor: melted cocoa + honey + coconut oil + almond butter.Banana flavor: bananas + peanut butter + cinnamon + soy milk.I just mixed them, put in a mould, put a wooden stick in each hole, and put in the freezer. Then, I could grab one in the morning and eat on the way to work as a breakfast.Now, winter is coming and it is unpleasant to eat at freezer temperature, so I wonder if I can achieve the same effect in refrigerator temperature: is there an ingredient I can add to the mixture, that will make it freeze, and stick to the stick, in the refrigerator?

How to find a employer that allows staff to publish academic papers As a Ph.D. candidate, one of the things that I am looking for, when looking for a job, is the opportunity to continue publishing academic papers related to work. I know that there are some companies whose workers publish academic papers, such as: Google, Microsoft, IBM and Yahoo. I am wondering whether there is some website that compares companies according to how academic they are. E.g, counts the number of publications per worker in each company, etc. Is there any website that publishes such information?

Can I become flexible enough to touch the ground? I am 175 cm. high, 45 years old. When I stand with my legs straight and bow down, my palms are about 70 cm above the ground. I have done this daily for several weeks, hoping that I will improve in time, but the distance to the ground does not seem to shorten.Is there any exercise I can do, that will make me flexible enough so that I can touch the ground?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Tofu as a growing medium? I just had a strange idea of no actual significance, but I was just staring at a block of tofu and wondered if you could plant things in it. Has anyone tried this? How does/would tofu fair as a growing medium. How would plants grow differently in hard, medium, and soft tofu?

What is the functional role of the subtonic chord? In this chartthe subtonic major chord can come before the mediant and submedian chords. Does this imply that it has a tonic functionality? If so that seems counter-intuitive; it seems to share more in common with the dominant chord than the tonic. On the other hand, if it's a dominant function, why would you have a i-VII-III... progression? Wouldn't it make more sense for the VII to fall later, towards the end of the phrase.(Also I'm assuming that the VII actually refers to the bVII chord, but if I'm wrong please correct me on that)

How do I know where to place holes on an instrument? I've been trying to build a double reeded instrument out of plastic straws. I've run into a problem though, when I place fingering holes, the instrument doesn't seem to follow the $$f=/frac{nv}{4L}$$ formula. Is there a formula that would allow me to calculate where along the instrument I should place the holes?

Dill, cilantro, and fennel cross pollinating I've read several conflicting pieces of information on the growing of dill, cilantro, and fennel near one another. I've read that fennel and dill will grow well together and make good companion plants, however I've also read that they will cross pollinate to make a foul-smelling hybrid. I've read that dill and cilantro will cross pollinate to create a rather disgusting culinary useless hybrid, but I've also read that they can be beneficial to one another's growth. I have not, however, read anything on cilantro and fennel growing together. How do these three plants fare when grown with one another, and is there any risk of cross pollination or hybridization?To cut costs I am planning on using the seeds again. I (personally) don't particularly care about hybrids or GMOs, I just want to be able to use the plants as herbs. However, should the hybrids not be culinarily useful, I would begin to care.

How to put up my string items without tangling When I put up Christmas lights onto my house, I must first untangle them. Is there any way when I put them (or any similar item) away for them not to become tangle and knotted without buying something specifically for that purpose.

Is maral root useful as a companion plant? I was looking at rarer plants to grow for natural pesticide purposes and I was wondering how maral root fares. What conditions does this plant need to grow? At what temperature, water amounts, soil conditions, etc. can this plant grow in, is it hardy or highly sensitive? Also, will it interfere with other plants?

{  "personalized_answer": "It seems like you're delving into the complexities of power and control in literature and beyond. While 'Conquest' and 'usurpation' might seem similar, they often carry different connotations. 'Conquest' typically refers to the act of taking control or power over a place or people by force, while 'usurpation' implies taking power or property by illegal or improper means. If you're looking for a science fiction story that explores the theme of a computer program governing society, you might want to check out 'The City and the Stars' by Arthur C. Clarke. This novel, set in a future where a computer system called "Layla" governs the society, could provide a rich context for your exploration of these themes. Would you like to discuss any specific aspects of this story or explore other related works?"}

[rank0]:[W709 14:59:49.434133118 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
