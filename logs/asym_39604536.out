# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Is Boogiepop series connected to the Boogie music genre? Looking up the Oxford dictionary, the definition of "boogie" is:  A style of blues played on the piano with a strong, fast beat.From Wikipedia it is defined as:  Boogie (sometimes called post-disco) is a rhythm and blues genre of electronic dance music with close ties to the post-disco styleAs I am unfamiliar with the genre, I tried a few sample of boogie music. I don't really see it matches the atmosphere of the anime (neither the 2000 nor 2019 adaptation). Boogiepop himself "seems fond of whistling the prelude to Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" which is also not related to boogie genre.Also I don't see it too related to pop genre either.

Boogiepop and Others Promotional Trailer references 2019's "Boogiepop and Others" TV series has a promotional trailer. However the trailer is kind of "fake", because many footage are not present in the actual TV show.The main ones are:On Opera stageA man fighting a fire ability userBoogiepop walking closer to another girl, and the background switches with each swing from BoogiepopAre these referencing other unadapted stories in the series? If yes, which are those?

Meaning of telegraph code in the song "Planetes" The song Planetes in Guilty Crown begins with some telegraph encoding, which I think is Wabun code.Here is the YouTube link.My transcription is:-•-• -••-- •-- --•-- •- --•-• •-•-- -•--•which decodes to this:ni-yu-ya a-i-shi-te-ruNiyuya didn't make sense. Did I get something wrong?

In Master Keaton, is TV news being used as secret code based on real world practice? Vol.8 of Master Keaton starts with the TV broadcasting a news segment about 'a Lion was accidentally trapped inside the cage of leopards in some zoo near River Seine.' This was later explained that it symbolizes a royal family member being in danger overseas, and is used by the British government to secretly notify the related parties (agents?)Was this based on some real world practice?

Does Fez require controller which can vibrate? There are some FEZ puzzles which I can't solve. That led me to think that, maybe those require a controller which can provide vibration feedback (I am currently playing with keyboard). Is my guess correct?

Writing rule which states that two causes for the same superpower is bad writing I've read somewhere that there is this writing rule stating that, for some superpower, it would be less believable if two completely different settings are present in order to obtain the same superpower. In the article, I remember it mentioned in the movie Spiderman (which I've not watched), the protagonist and another character gain the power through different means.What's this rule and does it have a name?

What does the letter at the end of Patema Inverted mean? Near the end of the movie, we see the letter from Lagos. However it seems to be encoded. What does it mean?

Is 'Sold Count' a good term I am writing a technical document, and in it I want to refer to the number of units sold for each product. I want to make it concise, and 'sold count' comes to mind. Does this term sound right? Are there better alternatives?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
What happened to Hibiya and Hiyori after they broke out of the time loop? (It's been over four years since I watched Mekaku City Actors and it wasn't the most coherent anime, so please forgive me if I've gotten any details wrong or missed something obvious.)In the episode "Heat Haze Daze", Hibiya and Hiyori are trapped in an infinite time loop in which Hiyori keeps dying, and Hibiya keeps trying and failing to save her. They finally break out of the time loop (I presume) when   Hibiya sacrifices himself to save Hiyori's life.The next time we see them is when Haruka breaks open the back of a van to find them bound and gagged inside. I don't recall there ever being an explanation of how they got there.What happened to Hibiya and Hiyori between them breaking out of the time loop and Haruka finding them in the van? Who put them there, and why?

Why didn't Roberta kill these characters? In Part 4 of Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail, Shenhua attacks Roberta and is swiftly backed up by Sawyer and Rotton. Roberta breaks Sawyer's chainsaw and one of Shenhua's kukris, has the two held at gunpoint... then just kicks Rotton in the balls and walks away, sparing all three of them.I haven't watched Part 5 yet, but so far this is the only time Roberta has shown mercy in the entire OVA. Later on in Part 4, she reacts to Eda helping her by promising to kill her painlessly, yet here she spares three random strangers who were trying to kill her, two-thirds of whom were still armed in some capacity. I don't understand why.It could be that Roberta's just trying to catch up to the American soldiers and/or Garcia, and doesn't want to waste time killing them, but she doesn't seem to be in that much of a hurry - as I noted, she walks away from the incident in question. It could also just be that she's gone completely insane at this point, and trying to analyse her actions is a waste of time. But I'd like to try anyway.Why didn't Roberta kill Shenhua, Sawyer, and Rotton?To repeat: I haven't seen Part 5 yet, so I don't want to Google anything in case I stumble across any spoilers. If the answer is "watch Part 5", so be it.

Why wasn't this character killed immediately? In Persona 5, after you   steal Okumura's Treasure, his Shadow is killed by an unseen assassin. This happens in the very same cutscene, literally two seconds after the Phantom Thieves have left the room.By my understanding, this should have resulted in    an immediate mental shutdown.And yet nothing happens until   the press conference on October 12th. Depending on how long it took you to clear the Palace, that's up to three weeks later.Now, I understand that the out-of-universe reason for this is that if   Okumura had died the moment you cleared the Palaceit would have completely messed up the game's timeline of events. But in-universe, it doesn't make sense, especially considering that   the villains were relying on Okumura dying at exactly that moment, in order to implicate the Phantom Thieves in his death.How should this be reconciled? In-universe, why didn't this character die immediately?

How to trick the reader into thinking they're following a redshirt instead of the protagonist? I'm currently planning a "magical girl" story, and I thought of an interesting way to start it, rather than launching straight into the backstory. It opens with a woman in her mid-thirties, complete with ponytail of death, walking through a city market while being stalked by a shadowy monster.What I want readers to expect is that the woman is either going to be killed by the monster, or saved from it in the nick of time by the heroine. What actually happens is that when the monster finally attacks, the woman transforms into a magical girl, beats the everloving crap out of the monster, and then destroys it with a magical laser beam. Surprise! She is the heroine.I want to try and preserve this surprise as best I can, and make the readers think they're following a redshirt or one-off character instead of the protagonist. Not referring to her by name until after the reveal will help, but it's probably not enough. What else can I do to achieve this?(I'm aware of answers on other questions to the effect of "don't trick your readers". In my case, this is supposed to be a pleasant surprise, so I feel like it's okay.)

Did Amara know what she was saying to Viktoria? Early on in Pacific Rim: Uprising, after Amara first clashes with Viktoriya, one of the other cadets offers to teach Amara a few words of Russian "to help you get along with her", or something to that effect. Later on in the film, when they get into another argument, the following exchange occurs:  Amara: [in Russian] Kiss my ass.  Viktoriya: What did you say?!  Amara: [in Russian] Kiss my ass. [in English, to the other cadet] Am I saying that right?  [Viktoriya attacks her]There are two possible interpretations of this scene:Amara knew exactly what that phrase meant and was deliberately trying to rile Viktoriya up.The other cadet tricked her when he taught her that phrase, and Amara thought she was saying something that would defuse the situation. (This was my initial interpretation of the scene.)Which interpretation is correct? Was Amara knowingly telling Viktoriya to kiss her ass, or was it a misunderstanding?

What made Sakuya decide to switch sides? In Rewrite, Sakuya, Chihaya's butler, is nothing but antagonistic towards the protagonist Kotarou from the moment they first meet. He calls him insulting names and is generally just a bit of an asshole. It later turns out that both he and Chihaya are working for Gaia, the eco-terrorist group who want to destroy all human life   (and who ultimately succeed in the final episode of Season 1).Then, around Episode 8 or so, he randomly shows up in the magic forest and saves Kotarou's life. He announces he's now working with Kotarou and friends against Gaia, offers to train Kotarou, and becomes considerably less antagonistic towards him. Absolutely no explanation is given for this, and to me it seemed to come completely out of left-field.What prompted Sakuya to change sides like that so suddenly? I think Chihaya may have already defected by this point, but surely that can't be the only reason?

How did Sylar break out of Hiro's time-stop? I'm basing this question mostly off of memory, and my memory is not 100%, so forgive me if I've gotten any details wrong here.After spending most of Season 1 trying to track down Sylar, Hiro finally confronts him just as he   accidentally fatally stabs his mother.He stops time, but admits to Ando that he can't bring himself to kill a man who is begging for forgiveness, as Sylar is at that moment. Sylar then suddenly turns round and addresses Hiro directly while time is still stopped - I can't remember what he says, but the net result is that Hiro and Ando flee without attacking Sylar.By my recollection, Sylar didn't have any powers that would have allowed him to do that. I checked Wikipedia and he never absorbs any super-speed abilities, and this question indicates that he never had any space-time manipulation abilities like Hiro did.So how did Sylar break out of Hiro's time-stop? Did he have some other power I've forgotten about? Or am I misremembering the whole thing and he didn't actually do that?

Why did Grievous tell Obi-Wan he was trained in the Jedi arts when Obi-Wan already knew? In Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, when Obi-Wan challenges Grievous to a lightsaber duel, Grievous replies:  You fool! I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku!This makes it sounds like he and Obi-Wan have never fought before, and he's gloating that Obi-Wan doesn't know what he's up against. But The Clone Wars firmly establishes that Obi-Wan and Grievous had already engaged in at least one lightsaber duel prior to this point. Obi-Wan already knows that Grievous is trained in the Jedi arts, and Grievous knows that Obi-Wan knows.So why did Grievous say this? Why would he brag about something Obi-Wan already knew perfectly well?I know the out-of-universe answer is a) the line was for the audience's benefit, and b) they hadn't written The Clone Wars yet, but I'm looking for an in-universe answer, if one exists.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Who was able to resist more punches from Saitama, Boros or Garou? It's known few characteres can resist punches from Saitama when he's half serious (probably only Boros, Garou and Orochi until now)Who was able to resist more punches from Saitama, Boros or Garou?

Was Suiryu or Garou who defeated Saitama in Virtual Reality? In OVA #4 season 2, Saitama is defeating playing Virtual Reality and Genos says the one who defeated might be able to defeat Saitama in real life. Then we see those moving to the finals of the competition are Suiryu and Garou.Was Suiryu or Garou who defeated Saitama in Virtual Reality?

Why Saitama was so poorly promoted after he defeated this insanely powerful enemy? So, in the battle between the Hero Association and the Monster Association,   Saitama defeated Garou.Why was he only promoted to Class A? 

Is Garou actually evil? So, Garou apparently doesn't kill his opponents.Later in the manga, he   saves a kid from monsters.And in the webcomic, Saitama says what Garou actually wanted to be is    a hero.Is Garou actually supposed to be evil?

Can Black Sperm return to be as powerful as he was? After the battle with Garou in the webcomic,   Black Sperm becomes Saitama's pet in a weakened stateCan he regrow his cells and become as powerful as he was, or all the cells he lost can't be recovered?

Which threat level is Garou? AFAIK , season 2 of One Punch Man is going to have Garou as the main villain. Which threat level is Garou according to the manga?

Which threat level was Garou when he defeated Tank Top Master? As far as I understand, Garou got stronger during the series. How strong was he when he fought Tank Top Master? Which threat level was Garou when he defeated him?

Did King get any stronger? At the end of season 2 episode 1 , Saitama asks King if he's going to keep lying about being strong and King says he doesnt know. Then Saitama tells him he could quit or get stronger. Did King get any stronger as the story continues? (in the manga)
# Current post question:
Was Saitama sweating with worry when he saw Garou in this scene?

[rank0]:[W709 14:32:14.152510805 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Is giving child ride considered spoiling? My sister lives 15-20min walk from her school but my mom gives her a ride in the car every morning.  Is this considered spoiling the child or no.  In my opinion it is because I think it's a perfectly close enough distance to walk.

Is investing all your savings into a small number of individual stocks risky? I want to invest 90% of my savings into stock market and split between 4-6 stocks.  How risky is this and is it a bad idea.  I feel like the stock market goes up over time so unless something like 2008 depression happens again there is actually not that much risk?Note that I'm trying to turn this into a form of income and not simply getting decent returns for retirement etc.  I am okay with reasonable risk so I can work less hopefully.

bread made with egg safe to leave outside? I have some bread that has egg in it.  Safe to leave the bread at room temp after baking?  Im asking because I wouldn't leave scrambled eggs at room temp but is bread ok?

What causes a stock to make an EXTREMELY big move in a short period? Today (8/19/20) I was paper trading a stock REDU.  I was in a short position without a stop loss and stock went from 6.74 to 7.48 or over 10% in a span of less than 30 seconds, faster than I could react to get out.  Is this due to low trade volume and the bid and ask became so wide?  or someone manipulating the market?My question is how can I avoid this scenario in the future.  Would a stop loss work to get me out? or avoid these types of stocks in general.

Is there any reason to not buy if mortgage is comparable to rent? I'm curious: Say if you could buy a property or choose to rent and the mortgage per month on the property is similar to (or even lower) than the rent in your area, is there any reason to not buy?Assuming you are not looking to move and stay in the area long term.Also a follow up question, if you paid half the mortgage somewhere and want to leave, is it easy to transfer the mortgage to someone else and get what you paid so far back?

"Professional software development experience" meaning A job is asking how many years of "professional software development experience" I have. What does that mean exactly? Any software development done for a job? Or something more strict like using SDLC, git, working in a team, etc?

What is usually better in basketball, a 2-pointer and-1 opportunity or a made 3-pointer? 2-pointer and-one obviously gets a foul on an opposing player but you are not guaranteed to make the free throw, while a 3-pointer is guaranteed 3 points.Which would be more advantageous to a team, specifically in a NBA game where the free throw conversion rate is around 75%?It seems like a bucket and-one is better just by observing player celebration.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
First time repairing a rear wheel hub, I am hearing bearing on bearing rattle/clicks when spinning For the sake of doing a restoration I just serviced a rear wheel: new bearings, new grease, new axle and new dust caps.I think I have put enough grease. When spinning the wheel before putting it on the bike I was feeling a bit of crunchiness but no noise. After putting the wheel on, truing it, setting the brakes, I did a spin test: there is no resistance, the wheel does spin for a while with a single push. Unfortunately there is a significant metal on metal noise, feels like a bearing on bearing friction. The wheel has also a tiny bit of play but it is attached safety to the bike.Here is a video with audio: https://imgur.com/a/BTmexIYAlso, I had to replace the dust caps by a wee bit smaller ones (25mm vs 28mm), but I do not think this is to blame.

New DIY project: restoring this bike from the bins. How can I service this back wheel? I picked a broken bike from the garbage around the block. The bike has some damage. It looks like a stolen bike (spray paint awfully over original color), so it must have had some tough love. I have identified the brand and model from its parts but no one has reported it stolen, yet. It will turn into a restoration job soon.I am not the sharpest bike wrench so I could use some advice. Most parts are in good state. Obviously it needs new brake pads and new tires, and most probably a new chain, as this one is full or rust. The rear derailleur was so bent into the spokes that it broke. Definitely needs replacement by a new one.The work that needs to be done on the rear wheel is not clear to me. The spokes are unbroken but it needs truing. I found it with some of its bearings opened, the ones on the non-driving side. When looking inside: not much contamination but some of the balls seem to be missing. I already have grease. Can I just buy any balls bearings? How do I know how many I need? Also the lock ring on these bearings is crooked? See pictures. Will it close? Or do I need a new one? Is it needed to buy a new axle + bearings? Is it simpler?Here are some pictures https://imgur.com/a/UbB8NrlMany thanks.

How/where can I find replacements for these 'wheel bearing caps'? I have started the restoration of a bike picked up from the bins. The bike has taken some abuse. The rear wheel axle was broken, same for the two "bearings" caps or dust seals. I am not sure how to name these. I am providing pictures here for illustration https://imgur.com/a/fKflsyxIt was really to get a replacement for the bearings and the axle, but that cap piece - maybe because of not knowing its name - I am not able to see it for sale anywhere. I am not sure how standard or custom these pieces are. The hub has no brand or logo. The bike is a carrera zelos if this helps.

What type of bottom bracket is this (pictures)? What tools do I need to replace it? This bike has a lot of play on the bottom bracket. Here are pictures:What replacement can I buy for it? It looks like a square tapper BB to me, how do I measure which size I need? I do not have the tools to open it and read on the piece at this stage. Hence, what tools do I need to replace it?

Cannot fit in the new rain shower head I just bought a shower head from Amazon (Chinese seller I think). As soon as I received it I removed the old one and tried fitting it in. But it cannot be screwed in. The diameter seem identical to the old one with my bare eyes. But the old one screws in easily and this one stops after one turn. I tried cleaning the threads with a toothpick, adding some WD40 and it does not get any easier. Do I need a connector? How universal are the connector widths?I have added pictures.ps: It is not easy to force as the disk part can spin 360 degrees around the connector, hence I have preferred not to force for now.Link to the item I purchased if it helps: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07SSZ9RH7/

The hose reel does not rewind anymore We were using the hose to clean a patio and because we needed the whole length we pulled its full length out of the reel. It did not feel like anything clicked or broke when doing so, it was done in a fairly gentle way.The problem is that the reel does not rewind the hose anymore. There is a lever button on the side to switch locked and unlocked positions but toggling it has no effect.When trying to spin the wheel manually with the fingertips, it does not move. As if the spring is maintaining it in locked position.What can we try?Images here https://imgur.com/a/z9AZtxd

Is it necessary to shut off the water supply to a radiator in order to replace a radiator valve? There are barely any instructions in the manual. Do I need more than a spanner to do replacement?Is it necessary to shut off the water supply to the radiator in order to replace the radiator valve?

How do I install a bidet spray on my toilets? I have decided that I have flushed enough trees down my toilets and wish to install a bidet spray. I am looking at something like https://amz.run/3RThThe setup seems to be working with toilets connected through a flexible hose to the water line. The T branching is put on one end of such hose. Unfortunately, my toilets are connected with an elbow pipe, non bendable of course, see attached picture. Is it still possible to install the spray? Do you think I need to replace the elbow with a hose first?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How to care for bent avocado tree I have an avocado tree I started from a pit. It has lived in upstate New York indoors and has grown tall and skinny. I recently moved to Atlanta, Georgia and so can have it outdoors more. The tree is somewhat crooked. Should I prune it? (Possibly even cutting off the top half of the tree?)Should I get a bigger pot?Should I get some kind of system going to stabilize and/or straighten it out? Should I keep it outside all of the time?

Trees for southern Idaho/northern Utah mountain environment My goal is to find trees that would survive in the fairly harsh climate of the mountains of northern Utah/southern Idaho (near Bear Lake). Being in the mountains, it is around 7,000 feet. The trees need to be able to withstand cold temperatures of roughly -20 degrees Fahrenheit as well as be drought resistant. However, we can water them once or twice per week in the summer. What kind of trees meet the bill?We have had some success with aspen trees and some, but less, success with pine trees.

What to do with this Meyer Lemon Tree? I have a Meyer Lemon Tree that used to be doing well, but has lately been losing most of its leaves. See How to tell if indoor lemons are ready to pick for what it used to look like. I had it outside for a while, then brought it inside when it got cold. Since then, it has been not doing well. Around the time of when I brought it in, I harvested two big lemons from it. The first image shows what it looks like. The second is a closeup. There are lots of new buds---are those for lemons or for new leaves?

How to politely tell someone they did not hit "reply to all" in an email? It happens sometimes that somebody (likely) meant to reply all in an email chain, but (likely) accidentally just replied to the last person that sent the email. What is a polite way to inform them of this/ask if they actually intended to reply all?

Is there any chance for this cactus? I have this cactus cactus, but it leans heavily. The bigger it gets, the more it tends to lean. It leaned even before I repotted it, and is even worse after. Is there any saving it, or should I just get rid of it? I live in Georgia and am able to have it outside about half of the year. (I am not equipped to have indoor heat lamps or anything like that.)

How to Get Indoor Avocado Tree to Branch Out I have three indoor avocado trees that I have grown from seed (pictured). I have cut two off after they got fairly high and both have started a new branch (the one on the right has barely started its branch and the one on the left and in front has awhile ago). The one in the back I haven't cut off the stem, but I have pruned it extensively after the leaves got really big. It is now starting with some new growth at the top. I have also been picking off the leaves of the one in the front left. I don't want them to get very tall and I want them to branch out, but so far they don't like to grow leaves or branches unless it is more near the top. How can I do this? Is there any way to get the little bumps (that are present every so often up the stem) to turn into branches? How should I be pruning these trees - branches and leaves? Is what I have been doing so far completely wrong?

How to improve finger style guitar playing I am a competent, but not amazing, guitar player who is very comfortable with the usual chords as well as basic fingerpicking patterns. I would like to take it to the next level and be able to improvise and play something along the lines of (though not initially as complicated as) this by James Taylor: 
                
             - starting at about 2:40. Another example of something that I would love to do is 
                
            . As opposed to learning a particular song, which is fine, I am more interested in learning general techniques that I can improvise with when I am playing around on the guitar.What resources/tutorials/lessons would you recommend that can help me play interesting things like in these videos? 

What does "her mama leaned hard" in this Emmylou Harris Song mean? I was listening to the song "Red Dirt Girl" by Emmylou Harris, and didn't understand one of the lyrics: "her mama leaned hard." What does this mean?Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hardGot in trouble with a boy from townI did find one definition from this blog, but it doesn't seem to be what I am looking for: "To lean hard you must get under God’s feet and submit to His plans and purposes, even if you do not see them fully or understand them at all. Leaning means shifting all the weight of the burden from your shoulders to His."

[rank0]:[W709 14:40:42.467892204 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How open should I be with my PhD supervisor about the problems in my personal life? My marriage has been going through some problems in the last year which has affected my PhD. My supervisor has been very understanding and was keen for me not to interrupt and granted me a two month extension on my upgrade paper. Last week my wife walked out. She came back but this totally put me off my studies. I was supposed to hand in a paper - an optional paper since this was for a journal submission - but I haven't even drafted it and the draft was due tomorrow.My supervisor knows I have been having marriage problems but she doesn't know any details. Also she doesn't talk about her personal life much and I don't know if she's the kind of person who would be receptive to such details, so I have so far withheld them. Should I tell her my wife walked out? At the moment I have just said there was an incident. She also knows that I have been diagnosed with symptoms of moderate/severe depression, but I thought it best that she knew this since it could affect my work.Should I carry on being vague or should I test the water and treat her like an intelligent adult and give her more context and details of my issues? Or should I just keep the personal stuff as separate as possible?

My PhD seems daunting and overbearing. How shall I regain motivation and interest? EDIT: I should clarify this is not the first draft of my PhD, it's the first draft of my upgrade document to go from MPhil to PhD.I have been working on my PhD for about two years now, it is a six year part-time program. I have a very good relationship with all my supervisors and they are very supportive. I am fortunate to be part of a good university which is open-minded and free-thinking. I also have attracted the interest of a well-known external academic who is an authority within the field and who wants to be involved. I am very lucky.The problem is that I am just not that interested or convinced by my research [chiefly its significance]. I have to submit my upgrade document [MPhil > PhD] in about five week's time, and the viva is a week after that. I have written a draft document which is 12,000 words and my main supervisor has written a lot of comments which are suggestions for improvements. The issue is that I do not feel that interested or compelled to work through them. I am under the impression that my supervisor is not that convinced by my research, even though she keeps saying she has no concerns. I feel my research is too vague, too broad but also too overbearing. It incorporates three disciplines [at the advice of one of my supervisors], disciplines A B and C. Discipline A I am not that interested in - I was for my master's but now I find it quite tedious but it is quite an important part of the whole. It is a well-worn discipline and feels rather old and stale to me now. Discipline B is quite new and interesting, I have published within this discipline. Disipline C is very new and up-and-coming. I find it quite exciting and my supervisor has written the least amount of comments about it in my draft paper, which I take to mean she has the least amount of complaints about it [she has a lot of comments to make about dispclines A/B]. She has also said that discpline C is a 'key' part of the PhD. I do not know what to do. I am really not that interested and the whole thing seems so daunting. My PhD focuses on A and B mostly with C being only a feature, but I am wondering whether I should switch things round entirely and make it more about C. I feel I will not really be able to convince my panel about the significance of my research in the viva if I am not excited about it or convinced myself. In my master's I was always keen to research and write, now I am not, but I know I would be if the topic were carried out a bit differently. What shall I do, how shall I regain interest? My PhD seems rather fluffy and not sharp enough. Additionally, I am daunted by the scope of the whole thing: it seems too large to work through and 'bigger' than me. I am kind of at a loss for what to do.

Should I talk to my supervisor about including a new field in my PhD? I am a part-time PhD student coming towards the end of my first year – I have another five years left. My PhD is in Music and I do like my topic a lot. However, in the last 18 months I have also become very interested in an area that is not that related to music – computing and open source. I started looking at it as something extra to learn before my PhD started and am now finding it difficult to put down. As well as this, I would like to integrate some aspects of what I have learned into my PhD. I just don't really know what and how. Is this something that I should bring up with my PhD supervisor or should I just "put up or shut up"? She may think it's a bit weird to mention it since she will probably feel that it doesn't really relate, however, computing (and its related ethics) are fundamental to the ways in which we undertake academic research these days. We've even had a few classes on software use. I feel that I could probably link the two in some way but little has come up yet which is obvious, though it may well present itself in the future. From past experience I tend to function at my academic best when integrating different challenging interests into my learning and I would love to integrate my learning of computing into my music PhD. I feel I have learned – and applied – a lot and I want to continue learning alongside my music learning and to combine the two in my topic. Question: should I raise this with my supervisor, float some ideas past her about this or should I just ignore it? If I do the latter the question may well come back to haunt me further down the line. I don't think I "can" (nor do I want to) give this up, well, not without forcing myself to since it fascinates me. Do others have experience of wanting to mix in new ideas/subjects into their PhDs and how did you go about it?For clarification - the PhD in Music is ethnomusicological, i.e. the PhD is to do with the study of music in culture and as culture rather than composition or performance.

Is there a preferable time of year when one should apply for a PhD in the UK? [Edited] I am very shortly going to be sending off my PhD application. I cannot apply quite yet because I am waiting on my bachelor's documentation which was withheld (library fines which are now cleared) but now it is in processing, and I do have my transcript. I have my master's documentation. The BA uni say they don't know when the cert will be ready, it could be a week or two, or longer presumably. The deadlines for PhD applications are set as the summer, but I know that many faculties like to have the applications in sooner because they want to decide on their student quantities. Is there some kind of unspoken deadline that I should shoot for in general [e.g. late Feb, Apr etc] or does it vary by institution? Does one lessen one's chances of acceptance if applying nearer to the official early summer deadlines?I should mention that a staff member in my choice of PhD uni has already approved my proposal and agreed to be my supervisor. Should I apply anyway without the BA cert and just say it is in processing [without going into reasons why]? I am not applying for funding.

How long should one wait for a reference before writing to the course convenor? I am getting a little worried about my PhD application. I submitted it three weeks ago with reference requests going out to Prof A and B. Prof B wrote to me the same evening to say it would be done asap, and Prof A didn't respond, but that's fine. Three weeks later and Prof A has written back and completed the reference, though nothing so far from B. I have written to B with a polite reminder but they haven't written back. How long do people take on average to get these things across and should I be concerned? I know these academics are very busy but at the same time this is the only thing holding the application up. Should I write to the convenor about my concern if this goes on for a couple more weeks? What other ways could I politely encourage a response?

Should I structure my CV in sections for relevant experience to PhD and day job work if the two are unrelated? I am applying for my PhD currently [in Music]. Part of the application concerns sending a CV. When I applied for my master's I just sent them my normal work CV [which had nothing to do with music] and that seemed to do the job to get the application through. However, I have done many music-related things over the years [A&R, promotion, journalism etc] and have constructed a CV around these for my new application as 'relevant experience' to the PhD. Should I include another section for my day job[s] as well [which have nothing to do with music] or should I just keep to relevant to the academic application?

Can I submit an abstract for an unwritten paper which will form part of my PhD? I am applying for my PhD to start this Autumn. There is a conference coming up soon with a theme which is very relevant to my PhD topic and I would like to submit an abstract for it, write the paper and then develop parts of it for my PhD at a later stage. Is it OK to write a paper for the conference and then later use parts of it for my PhD seeing as it is so relevant?EDIT: For a little more information, this is for a conference on music and the research has not been carried out yet. Additionally, the area that is being researched is one that has very little scholarly coverage. Due to this, the focus will not be so much on looking for a particular kind of result, but any result that will arise from literature review/qualitative interview data. Interviews have not been conducted but there is quite a bit of time to do so, I feel. I understand if this were a scientific conference that submitting an abstract would be a little risky, but seeing as this is the humanities, I think there is more room for interpretation.

Should I recommend accepting a manuscript with major revisions because of a strong topic, but quite poor content? I have been given my first manuscript to review for a journal. The topic is a very good one, it fills a research gap nicely and is an area that I specialise in. However, the execution of the paper is lacking. I am about halfway through making comments on it. The English is consistently poor in both spelling and grammar, and the structure is dire, which makes it hard to follow the main arguments. I am aware that bad English is no reason to reject a paper, but the English in this paper is very confused in many places, sometimes multiple times per paragraph, and it's a trial to follow.I believe that the paper could only be salvageable after a rewrite, but by a third party. I don't believe the author's English is good enough to bring it up to standard. I do not care about being 'kind' to the author, but the topic is so good that I would love to see it go through, but I am torn between accepting it with majors or recommending rejection.  My PhD supervisor has advised me to recommend rejection, but I am still unsure which way to go. Should I recommend acceptance after major revisions in the hope that it will improve based on my [now extensive] advice or just recommend rejection?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Letting students grade their own homework I am going to teach a course in algorithms to 2nd-year undergraduates. The grade in this course is composed of 90% exam and 10% homework. The problem is, this year we do not have enough personnel to grade the homework. Theoretically, it may be possible to change the grade struture and make it 100% based on final exam, but, this will reduce the incentive of students to study and practice during the semester, which I think will harm their learning experience.So, I thought of the following scheme: the students will have to submit each assignment before the next TA session. The TA will explain the solutions during the session, and then each student will grade his/her own homework.Sure, some students might be tempted to give themselves 100 on all assignments, but I believe this will not be very harmful since:All assignments together compose only 10% of the grade, so every single assignment is less than 1%. Even if many students get 10% for free, the final exam is still sufficient to differentiate the good from the bad students. The group consists of excellent students (the top 20%, based on their 1st year mean grade). I believe most of them want to succeed in the exam, so they will take this as an opportunity to track their own progress during the course, rather than an opportunity to just get some points for free.What do you think about this scheme? 

Grades are too high for the department - what should I do? I recently taught an undergraduate seminar course, in which each student has to read a research paper, summarize it and present it to the class. In the first lesson I explained to the students the components of the grade: attendance, summary writing, and presentation quality. Most of the students did great jobs: attendance was near full, summaries were good, and presentations were great. Many of them did more than I expected - they contacted the paper's authors to get more information, presented movies and demos, engaged the class in discussions, etc. So, when I wrote the grades to myself, most of them were between 90 and 100. But then, when I told this to the department vice-chair, he told me "what have you done? You will cause a grade-inflation! The department policy is that the average grade on seminar courses should be at most 85!"I totally understand this policy - grades that are too high might show that the course was too easy, and they do not sufficiently distinguish between good and better students. Also, they might be unfair to students who took the course in previous years.However, I am not sure what I should do now. I haven't published the grades to the students yet. Should I just re-scale the grades so that 90 becomes 70? I feel this is somewhat unfair to the students who worked hard for their presentations. Are there better options?

What to do if most of my students have switched to a better lecturer's class? I teach a certain course which is part of the obligatory undergraduate curriculum. I teach two groups out of four; the other two groups are taught by two other lecturers. In one group I have about 20-30 students. The other group also started with the same number, but students left the group gradually, and now there remain only 5 or even less; the others go to the other lecturer who gives the same lesson in parallel. One reason is probably that I am a new teacher and still not very good at teaching. Another reason is that the other lecturer is very good. I feel that some of the 5 students remaining in my class do so only because they are being polite. I appreciate it very much since I put a lot of effort in preparing the lessons, but it is not very efficient for me or for them. So, I thought of suggesting to the remaining students that they move to the other lecturer's group. This way, they will have a better lecturer and I will have more time for research  (the other lecturer said it's OK with him). What might be the implications of such a step? UPDATE: Thanks a lot for all the feedback. While there are many great answers, the one thing that convinced me to keep going was the fact that this is the only way I can become a better teacher. So today I came to class as usual. For some reason, the number of students rised to 10.

How can I politely decline to guide a student? I am a lecturer in a department in which undergraduate students have to do a final-year project guided (= supervised) by a faculty member. Faculty members do not have to guide students: those who do, get extra payment for this.Most students who want me to be their guide are great and I am happy to guide them, but a few of them - I suspect - will be very "not fun" to work with: when they took a course of mine previously, they argued a lot about their grade, complained a lot about the course rules, etc. They made me spent a lot of time and energy on futile arguments rather than on productive teaching. I do not want to guide these students - I feel it will be a waste of my time and energy, not worth the extra payment.However, if I just tell them bluntly "I do not want to guide you since I do not like you", they will be very insulted.I cannot filter them out based on their grades, since their grades are similar to the average.I could say that "I am too busy to guide you", which is true, but I am not too busy to guide other students, and the student will probably find this out.How can I politely reject their request without insulting them?

Should I prepare new homework exercises each year, 20% of the final grade is homework? This year I prepare a new course (in programming, but it could be any other course). I spend a lot of effort in creating homework exercises. This is fun, but also very time-consuming.I wonder if I can use the same exercises next year, when I teach this course again. The main problem is that, once the solutions are out, surely some students next year will be able to get them and copy them. It may be possible to use some automatic plagiarism detection tools, but it is quite difficult and not very reliable.I believe the copiers will not gain much from copying, since the homework grade is only 20% of the final grade. On the contrary, they will lose since they will be less prepared for the exam, which is 80% of the final grade. My fear is that the temptation to copy will harm these students. So maybe I should create new exercises to avoid the temptation to copy.On the other hand, the students are grown-ups, if they choose to copy, it is their problem and they should bear the consequences of not knowing the material well enough. Should I work so hard each year, only to protect the copiers from their own faults?

Should I include teaching feedback from students in my CV? Some time ago, I worked as a teaching assistant in a college. That college had an online form for collecting student feedback. After the end of the year, they sent me an official letter with my final "teaching grade" and the verbal feedback, both of which are very good.Now, I am near the end of my Ph.D. and I am working on my CV. Should I include this feedback? I thought of including it in the end, after the "recommendations" section, since these are officially-documented recommendations from past students. Is this a good idea?

Efficient use of the class time when all lectures are already on Youtube I am teaching an obligatory course to undergraduates. There are about 160 registered students, divided into four classes of forty. Each class is three academic hours.Last year, my lectures have been videotaped and put on Youtube (with my consent). The students probably liked it a lot since over 80% of them stopped coming to the class and just watched the lectures from the convenience of their homes.This year, I have to teach the same course again, and it seems to me a waste of time to say the same things again when they are already videotaped. So I thought of making it obligatory for all the students to watch the videos of last year before class (or just learn the material from the textbook, if they prefer). Then, I could use the class-time more efficiently, e.g.:Answer specific questions of students about the material;Give personal feedback to students regarding their homework submissions;etc.The problem is that the 20% students who do prefer to learn in class than at home might object to this, since this puts a lot of extra-load on them – they have to watch a video rather than just sitting in class.So my question is: how can I efficiently use the class-time, while still being fair to all kinds of students?

How to encourage students to answer their peers' questions We have a forum in which students can ask questions about the course material, homework exercises, etc. Usually I answer all the questions. I want to encourage students to answer some questions too.One option is to give some bonus points in the final exam to students who answer a substantial number of questions. Another option is to create a reputation scheme like in stackexchange, and give bonus points to the three students with the highest reputation at the end of the term.The problem is that these two schemes are manipulable: two students can conspire to have student A ask questions and student B immediately answer them, and vice versa. Is there a better way to encourage students to answer their peers' questions?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
What to do if ellipses are already in a text What should I do to let a reader know that in a quote the ellipses aren't mine and have been placed by the original author? This is the quote:  My home university did a study of its alumni a few years back, and they discovered that out of all the various degree subjects, the one that led to the highest average income was ... mathematics. (Stewart, Letters, 1)

What is the axiological basis of the preference of truth to falsity? Axiologically speaking, why is truth the preferred logical value by humans? In general, why do we prefer true statements to false ones? What about the value of true makes a statement "right," while false is "wrong?" Specifically, why do true statements seem to be valued higher than false statements and why does our day-to-day language seem to favor factual statements?

Why are true and false the only truth values used in mathematics? Why do we use only true and false? It is possible to have many states in-between in fuzzy logic and other many-valued logics. If we assign numbers to true and false, such as 1 and 0 respectively, what would be the logical interpreation of -1, i, j or k (with i,j,k as defined for quaternions)?  Is there any reason for this dichotomy? What type of statement would have these truth values if such a statement existed?

What punctuation should I use with a quote like this? I have this sentence:  Executive order 9066 allowed "the Secretary of War and the Military Commanders ... to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may impose."My question is should a comma go before this quote? Or should I use a colon? Or does this quote not need punctuation before it? And why?

Does the Bible ever mention class systems? Does the Bible ever talk about class systems? If so what does it say about them? Does it give a recommended class hierarchy at any point? Would a classless society be allowed?See also this question at politics se (there are links to more questions at other religious sites there).

Tofu as a growing medium? I just had a strange idea of no actual significance, but I was just staring at a block of tofu and wondered if you could plant things in it. Has anyone tried this? How does/would tofu fair as a growing medium. How would plants grow differently in hard, medium, and soft tofu?

Why does the USDA handle the food pyramid? It seems weird to me that the Department of Agriculture administers the food pyramid. They have close ties to the food production industry, so it seems like they would have incentives to set nutrition policies that are benificial to agriculture or food processing businesses, rather than policies that are healthy.Why isn't this handled by another department, like the CDC or Department of Education, which isn't associated with the agriculture industry?I realize that the "food pyramid" is no longer a pyramid, but I would include MyPlate in this as well.

What is the functional role of the subtonic chord? In this chartthe subtonic major chord can come before the mediant and submedian chords. Does this imply that it has a tonic functionality? If so that seems counter-intuitive; it seems to share more in common with the dominant chord than the tonic. On the other hand, if it's a dominant function, why would you have a i-VII-III... progression? Wouldn't it make more sense for the VII to fall later, towards the end of the phrase.(Also I'm assuming that the VII actually refers to the bVII chord, but if I'm wrong please correct me on that)

{  "personalized_answer": "The term 'consumption and fever' in the context of biblical texts often refers to a severe and debilitating illness. In the Bible, it is sometimes used to describe a terminal condition or a prolonged, weakening sickness. For instance, in 2 Kings 5:17, Naaman, after being healed of leprosy, threatens to give a present to Elisha, saying, 'As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will neither give thee money nor present: but as the Lord liveth, which delivered me out of all the powers of Syria, when I came to thee to be healed: If thy servant can receive of thy hand any thing, of thy servants, thou knowest that a man doth so; but as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not give thee aught. And he said, Be content, take two talents: for I said, I will not take aught of thee: and he urged him to take it, and would not receive it. And Naaman said, Let there, I pray thee, come to thy servant twice, and let him apply but the stubble of thine oven upon my flesh, according to the saying of thy servant: and it shall be well. And he went out from his presence in a rage. And Elisha's servant Gehazi followed his master, and said unto him, My master, these are the sons of the prophets that came from beyond the river; they said to me, Go, I pray thee, into thine house, and bring forth thy wife, and thy two daughters that are there. And, behold, thy servant hath nothing in the house, save a little oil in a cruse. Now I have said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even vessels of oil. Get thee in, and shut the door upon thee, and upon thy two daughters, and pour out into all the vessels, and set them by. So he went from him a good way, into the city. And it came to pass, as he was come in, and had shut the door, and they were both alone, that she spake, saying, I am even now with child, and am in travail. And she said, What shall I do? And he said, Fear not: for thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. And she said, And where is my father? And he said, Thy father is as good as dead. And he answered, It shall also be as the Lord hath spoken. For she conceived, and bare a son about that time. And when the child was grown, the sons of the prophets came to him, and spake unto him, and said, Knowest thou that the Lord would make thy master rich, by cutting off thy master's children? And it came to pass about that time, that he fell sick of a great consumption and fever: wherefore he took him up to him into his bed, and turned away his face from the window. And the window was towards Ephraim, and he looked toward the wall, and wrote upon the wall, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Even so shall the man die, and he shall not recover. And Gehazi passed by, and said, All is well: my master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now the young man bemoans himself: go, inquire of the Lord for him, that he may not die. And Gehazi said, I will not go. And he said, Go thy way: for he said, He shall return with shame on his face, and shall fall. And Gehazi said, Be it far from me, O my master, my lord: behold, thy servant went no whither. And he said, Go thy way: for he said, He shall return with shame on his face, and shall fall. And Gehazi departed, and found him sitting in the midst of the chariots of Syria. And he said, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am. And Gehazi said, Thy father made thy father to ride on the ass, and to eat bread, and to drink wine: and I am thy father's servant from my youth. And the Lord said unto him, Because askest thou him concerning me, to know a certainty? therefore thou shalt not be free from blood. And the Spirit of the Lord took him up, and he fell in the midst of the chariots, and died. And Elisha came into the house, and saw him lying on his bed. And he said, Oil, oil! and they poured oil on him. And the Spirit of the Lord departed from him, and he died. And Elisha said, Roll me a large burthen of wheat, and lay it upon him. And they laid it upon him, and set a load of barley-corn, and laid him upon that. And he said, Take up and carry him into his house, and do to him according to all that thou doest for him. And it came to pass, as the Lord liveth, before whom I stand, surely, as soon as thou art departed from me to day, the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee hence: and thou shalt surely die. And Elisha died, and was buried. And the company of the prophets buried him: for they said, This evil came out of Israel to the house of Elisha. And it came to pass, as they buried him, that, behold, the man of God cried from the midst of the sepulchre, and said, O Elisha, O Elisha, thou shalt have vengeance on the Syrians in this day: thy blood be upon thy head, O Jezebel: surely, I will shortly avenge thy blood upon thee in the house of Syria. And he went up to the entrance of the gate, and looked, and there was the dead body of a lion. For they said, The lion hath torn him. And they came and told the king. And the king said, Gather together the men of Samaria, and let them come and see the dead body of the man of God, and let them bury him: for he hath troubled us with his preaching, and he shall restore to us the life of the king. And Elisha said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, as soon as the dead body shall be cast upon him that is dead of the son of the woman of Shunem, the leprosy of Naaman shall depart from him. And Elisha departed thence, and came to the brook Jordan, and cut down a tree, and cast it in the brook, when the waters began to flow violently. And he said, Wherefore dost thou disturb me? Have I now a pleasure on thee, to kill thee? And he took hold of the hair of Elisha: and Elisha rent his clothes. And he came to the house, and cast him upon the bed. But he lay there on his bed, and sent and called for his sons, the prophets. And one of them said, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he said, Take this vessel of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the Lord, I have anoint thee to be captain over Israel. Then he opened the door, and fled. And the Spirit of the Lord took Elisha away. And it came to pass, as he was going to turn from him, that he took hold of his clothes, and rent them. And he turned again to him from the chariot, and said, Come with me: and he arose, and went after him. And he came into the house, and cast him upon his bed. And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And he called her, and she stood before him. And he said, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, These two men abode in Ramah; and they said, Behold, there is a day of battle in Ramah, and let us go thither early to know all that shall be done. And it shall be, if it be according to your words, that when we come to the man, and find him not, we will return empty. And if a man say to us, Nay; your servants have not been there; and if we say, Behold, the man has a consumption and fever, and he will not hear us, for he will say, Ye play the prophets lies. And he said, Thus shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the Lord, Is it not because I have seen what they have done to my servant Naaman, that I have sent you to him, to deliver him from his leprosy? And it came to pass, when they were come to Ramah, that they lodged there. And as they were going up to Ramah, a spirit of the Lord took Elisha. And it came to pass, as they were going up to Ramah, that Elijah parted from them, and turned back, and took a journey to Ramah, and came to the house of a prophet. And the prophet's wife said, Alas! my lord, I am in travail, and thy servant wist not that thou wouldest go up this day. And Elijah said to her, Dost thou not know that there shall not be a consumption and fever on the man of God by the word of the Lord? And he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth; and Elijah passed by to him, and cast his mantle upon him. And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And Elijah said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee? And he returned from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and followed Elijah, and ministered to him. And it came to pass, when Gehazi passed by to take up the dead body, that the dead body was taken up, and Elisha came into the house, and laid his mouth upon him, and his eyes upon him, and his hands upon him, and he said, O Lord, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. And the Lord heard the voice of Elisha; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. And Elisha went up, and abode in Bethel. And the children of the place said to the parents, Why go ye in and out so quickly today? And they said, To make mention of the man of God: and the children said, While the man of God is yet alive, we be strong. And it came to pass, as he was going up, he came to the old prophet's house, where his sons were sitting: and they said to him, The old prophet's wife is come from the city, and his wife saith, Make this young man, the son of thy lord, as thy lord did make the young man Naaman. And he said unto them, Take a bow and arrows. And he went out with them into the open field, and said, Take the bow and arrows. And he took them. And he said to him, Put thy hand on the bow. And he put his hand on it: and he put his own hand on the king's hand, and said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. And Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them. And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king, Smite the ground with them. And he smote thrice, and stayed. And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: but now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice. And Elisha died, and was buried. And the company of the prophets buried him: for they said, This evil came out of Israel to the house of Elisha. And it came to pass, as they buried him, that, behold, the man of God cried from the midst of the sepulchre, and said, O Elisha, O Elisha, thou shalt have vengeance on the Syrians in this day: thy blood be upon thy head, O Jezebel: surely, I will shortly avenge thy blood upon thee in the house of Syria.

You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Writing rule which states that two causes for the same superpower is bad writing I've read somewhere that there is this writing rule stating that, for some superpower, it would be less believable if two completely different settings are present in order to obtain the same superpower. In the article, I remember it mentioned in the movie Spiderman (which I've not watched), the protagonist and another character gain the power through different means.What's this rule and does it have a name?

Is 'Sold Count' a good term I am writing a technical document, and in it I want to refer to the number of units sold for each product. I want to make it concise, and 'sold count' comes to mind. Does this term sound right? Are there better alternatives?

Exercise with pulmonary stenosis I have mild congenital pulmonary stenosis, which Wikipedia defines as:  outflow of blood from the right ventricle of the heart is obstructed  at the level of the pulmonic valve. This results in the reduction of  flow of blood to the lungs.It doesn't affect me at all in my daily life. Recently I thought I should start regular exercises, so I try to jog from time to time. What I want to ask are:How to tell if I am just using that as an excuse or am I really at my limit? My jogging habits are always run a little, walk a little, run a little, walk a little. I guess I switch when I am slightly out of breath.I understand these are more medical related, but none of the doctors I have visited can tell me anything in depth.Is there a particular type of exercises that are good for people like me?Would weight training be related to this at all?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
How to trick the reader into thinking they're following a redshirt instead of the protagonist? I'm currently planning a "magical girl" story, and I thought of an interesting way to start it, rather than launching straight into the backstory. It opens with a woman in her mid-thirties, complete with ponytail of death, walking through a city market while being stalked by a shadowy monster.What I want readers to expect is that the woman is either going to be killed by the monster, or saved from it in the nick of time by the heroine. What actually happens is that when the monster finally attacks, the woman transforms into a magical girl, beats the everloving crap out of the monster, and then destroys it with a magical laser beam. Surprise! She is the heroine.I want to try and preserve this surprise as best I can, and make the readers think they're following a redshirt or one-off character instead of the protagonist. Not referring to her by name until after the reveal will help, but it's probably not enough. What else can I do to achieve this?(I'm aware of answers on other questions to the effect of "don't trick your readers". In my case, this is supposed to be a pleasant surprise, so I feel like it's okay.)

How should my script refer to a character who's currently disguised as another character? I've recently resumed writing a series of scripts for an anime I've been planning. One of the characters has the ability to shape-shift, and there are several scenes in which she initially appears disguised as another character, before shape-shifting back into her normal self.So far, when writing these scenes, I've referred to the character using the name of the person she's disguised as, and only switched back to her real name after she transforms back again. However, the top answers to these questions suggest that I shouldn't do that; scripts are production documents, and it's imperative that the crew know exactly who's supposed to be in each scene, hence I should always refer to characters by their real names.But in the case of a character who's disguised as another character, how do I do this while also making it clear that they're pretending to be someone else right now?

How to avoid constantly starting paragraphs with "The character did this" "The character did that"? This is one of the tics I've noticed in my writing recently, and it's starting to bug me. Almost every single one of my paragraphs, particularly during dialogue sequences, starts with "The character did this". The main exceptions are when I use "'Quote', attribution, 'continuance'" instead.Here's a brief example:"I'll come visit you every now and again, if I'm not too busy," said Electron.Colin smiled. "I'm sure the other patients will appreciate that as well," he said. "You been to the children's ward yet?""Not yet," said Electron. "I think I'll leave that for last. The kids won't want me to go, you know?"Colin nodded. "You're a good man, Electron," he said. "I think we're gonna get along just fine. It's a pleasure to have you in my city."Electron returned the mayor's smile. "It's a pleasure to be here," he said.How do I get out of this habit? Or is this not worth worrying about?

Protagonist constantly has to have long words explained to her. Will this get tedious? A while back, I redrafted my NaNoWriMo 2017 story, but it still needs another draft. This question is about one of the concerns I have.The story takes place in a medieval fantasy setting, and the protagonist is a homeless orphan of about fourteen. As a result, she has a somewhat limited education, and at various points has to have long or complex words explained to her. At first I inserted these moments in order to underscore her limited education, but I kept on inserting them in order to pad things out just that little bit more.An example: the villain, whose thieves' guild the protagonist has infiltrated, is describing their master plan, and refers to a "network of clandestine tunnels" under the city. The protagonist's partner notices her confusion, leans over, and whispers, "'Clandestine' means 'secret'".I don't have access to the full draft right now, but off the top of my head, this happens at least six times in the space of 41,000 words, including once during what's supposed to be a very dramatic and emotional climax. I'm worrying that this is too frequent, and that it might get tedious or distract from the story somewhat. Will it? Or am I overthinking it?

How do I write transitions between thinking and speaking? I've just downloaded an open-source script-writing program, and have started converting the scripts for an anime I've been writing into industry-standard formatting.There are a few points in the scripts where a character says something out loud, then immediately thinks something else (which the audience hears in voiceover), or thinks something and then says something else out loud. In my (not-at-all industry-formatted) scripts, I've indicated these like so:  CHARACTER: Follow me, and stay quiet. We'll be out of here shortly. (in thought) I hope.Or:  CHARACTER: (in thought) This isn't good. (out loud) Guys, we need to get out of here now--I already know that I need to change "(in thought)" to "(V.O.)", but other than that, how do I convert these into industry-standard formatting?

Under what circumstances were F1 teams allowed to re-use old chassis built by other teams? It used to be the case that new F1 teams could re-use outdated chassis designs built by other teams, however I'm confused about the circumstances under which they could do so.In 1992, Andrea Moda were not allowed to use an updated version of the Coloni C4 chassis from 1991.In 2006, Toro Rosso were allowed to use an updated version of the Red Bull RBR1 chassis from 2005.That same year, Super Aguri were not allowed to use an updated version of the BAR 007 from 2005, but they were allowed to use an updated version of the Arrows A23 from 2002.To me, there doesn't seem to be any consistency to these decisions.What exactly were the rules governing whether new teams could re-use existing chassis designs? Were there specific circumstances in which teams could or could not use them, which would explain the situations outlined above? Or it was arbitrary and determined on a case-by-case basis?

Do these pictures depict David Hogg after two separate crises? A post circulating on social media - 48,000 shares and counting so far - depicts still images of two news reports, one in California in August 2017 and one in Florida in February 2018 after the Parkland school shooting.The post alleges that both images depict the same man, David Hogg:The allegation is that he is a "crisis actor", paid to pretend to be a witness/survivor of events that he was not actually present at, or that did not take place at all. I know there were similar allegations about the Sandy Hook shooting a couple of years back.I don't think we can answer whether he's a crisis actor or not and I don't know what the event he "witnessed" in August 2017 is. Is it the same man in both of these images?

Can EU member states reject the new copyright legislation? The European Parliament has recently voted in favour of planned reforms to copyright legislation, including the controversial Articles 11 and 13. This BBC News article about the vote states (emphasis mine):  It is now up to member states to approve the decision. If they do, they will have two years to implement it once it is officially published.This suggests that member states have the option to reject the new copyright laws, and choose not to implement them. Is this correct? Or will they have to implement the new laws whether they approve of them or not?This isn't a "Please tell me Article 13 can still be cancelled!" question. A lot of people seem to believe that the new rules are now set in stone, the article seems to suggest otherwise, and I'm genuinely curious what the actual situation is.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
are what we translate as "adjectives", "nouns", etc, the same kind of words in no indo-european languages? This question comes from questions in japanese SE. Keiyōshi 形容詞 are translated as adjectives. Meishi 名詞 are translated as nouns. But are they really the same kind of words that we mean with nouns, adjectives, etc. in English? I've already found 3 examples that arises a lot of doubts in me if they are the same thing. The first is a japanese word that I can't remember right now but that I've seen used as a noun, adjective or verb. May be there are words like these in English or Spanish, but I'm not sure if they are the same. For example the word paddle can be a verb, a noun or an adjective in English. The second is japanese words that they see as a noun and that we see as adjectives. The word "next" for japaneses is a clear noun. They know that it can be used as an adjective, but when giving an example of when it is used as a noun (what it really is according to japanese), I got this "when is the next?" that is a sentence that could come in a conversation between 2 persons about events , and one of them ask the other "when is the next (event)?" . wouldnt it be for english speakers, still an adjective because it modifies an implicit noun (event)? And the third is the word "suki" and similar words, that they see as a verb and it's translated as "to like" but it is used next to the verb desu (to be) So my question is, are what we translate as adjectives, verbs, etc, from other non indoeuropean languages, really what we understand as verbs, adjectives, etc?

Did Maradona ever score a goal with his right foot? I was hearing one of Pele's declaration stating Maradona couldn't score goals with his right foot. I thought he was talking in general, but then I started to think about goals made by him with his right foot and I couldn't remember any. I made a little research about this and I couldn't find any goal scored by him with his right foot, even though I clearly didn't watch all 300+ goals he made in his career (I'm not sure if all of them were recorded on TV by the way).I also remembered he used to kick the ball to the center of the field with his left foot even when he was in the right side of the field, giving the pass with a "Rabona" instead of with his right foot, because he was too much of a left-footed player. So, did he ever score a goal with his right foot, or did he never score one this way?

Which are the canonical sources for reading about Isa in Islam? Once I've read that Islam says Isa is going to return to Earth and fight a war. This is a different version of character personality that's given for Jesus in christianity were he says "Put your sword back in its place. for all who draw the sword will die by the sword". (I suppose Islam doesnt see the source where is quoted him saying that as a true source since it seems to be contradictory with someone later returning to fight a war) . I'm interested to read more about him in Islam to see how different they are portraited 

Did the italian parliament deny what mayor of Alzano Lombardo say about people in his city not being hospitalized because hospitals are full? There is a report from Italy in many webpage which says  "There are many elderly people at home with breathing difficulties.  They are not hospitalized because the hospitals are full" said the  mayor of Alzano Lombardo Carmelo BertocchiCoronavirus updateSome italians in forums say this is an hoax and one said the italian parliament denied this. Is there any record of the italian parliament denying this statement by Alzano Lombardo mayor?

Is Coronavirus transmission affected by the season of the host country / hemisphere? First when the Coronavirus outbreak happened in China, some people argued that the outbreak had to do with a supposed faulty chinese health care system, due to China not being a "developed country". But now in South Korea and Italy, supposed "developed countries" the cases are increasing even at over a 100% rate per day some days. Now in Italy the first cases appeared apparently in 31 January and in South Korea apparently in 20 January. So in 3 / 4 weeks those countries jumped from  units to hundreds / over a thousand cases. Yet in another "developed country" like Australia, the first case was reported 25 January , but the country was able to keep the number of cases below / in 23 for a month. Can be a factor contributing to the outbreaks in South Korea / Italy the fact that they are in the northern hemisphere / winter , and that Australia is in the southern hemisphere / summer by February? Could an outbreak as fast as those which happened in South Korea / Italy happen in a country which is in summer by the time it happens?

Is there any language where each character is pronounced differently depending on the word it's in? Languages like Japanese have different pronunciations for each character (in the kanji system in this case) , a kanji character can have up to 20 different pronunciations depending on the the word it is in. Is there or was there any language where each character is pronounced differently depending on the word it's in?

Could a drug used to treat patients of a infectious disease be used preventively in possible asymptomatic patients? According to Japanese flu drug reportedly shows promise against coronavirus in clinical trials  A Japanese drug used to treat new strains of the flu has shown promise  in being effective against the coronavirus in clinical trials.    Infected patients who were given the drug in Wuhan and Shenzhen tested  negative for the coronavirus after a median of four days, compared  with a median of 11 days for those who were not treated with the drugIn my country, 15,000 persons have to return from the hot spot areas for Coronavirus of Spain and Italy. A few days ago, a sport team traveled to the hot spot of Milan, and 1/3 returned infected but without Symptoms. People who arrives to my country from other countries are inmediately quarantine, but several times they violate the quarantine presenting a risk for other people. Could a drug used to treat patients of a infectious disease, be used preventively in possible asymptomatic patients?

How does self-defense apply to bodyguards? Suppose you have a bodyguard who sees someone is about to attack you. The attacker is not being a threat to the bodyguard but a dangerous threat to the bodyguard's employer (he could be killed) . Can the bodyguard act harming the attacker to prevent him from killing someone, even if he isnt the one who is being personally attacked or he will be punished if he does?

You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Is investing all your savings into a small number of individual stocks risky? I want to invest 90% of my savings into stock market and split between 4-6 stocks.  How risky is this and is it a bad idea.  I feel like the stock market goes up over time so unless something like 2008 depression happens again there is actually not that much risk?Note that I'm trying to turn this into a form of income and not simply getting decent returns for retirement etc.  I am okay with reasonable risk so I can work less hopefully.

What causes a stock to make an EXTREMELY big move in a short period? Today (8/19/20) I was paper trading a stock REDU.  I was in a short position without a stop loss and stock went from 6.74 to 7.48 or over 10% in a span of less than 30 seconds, faster than I could react to get out.  Is this due to low trade volume and the bid and ask became so wide?  or someone manipulating the market?My question is how can I avoid this scenario in the future.  Would a stop loss work to get me out? or avoid these types of stocks in general.

Is there any reason to not buy if mortgage is comparable to rent? I'm curious: Say if you could buy a property or choose to rent and the mortgage per month on the property is similar to (or even lower) than the rent in your area, is there any reason to not buy?Assuming you are not looking to move and stay in the area long term.Also a follow up question, if you paid half the mortgage somewhere and want to leave, is it easy to transfer the mortgage to someone else and get what you paid so far back?

limiting losses when shorting stock First time shorting stock just want to make sure I limit my losses correctly.  Say I short 100 shares of SPY and $272 and I  want to get out(cover my short) if it goes above $285 would the following sequence be right?Initiate transaction Action:SELL SHORT 100 shares of SPY.Initiate second transaction Action: BUY Type:STOP 100 shares SPY at $285 stop price.

Live off of $100k in savings for as long as possible What is the best way to live off of a set amount e.g. $100k - $150k in savings with no income? Assuming you can relocate to anywhere in the US with low cost of living, can you live off of this for 20+ years?

Is margin interest applied to intraday trades? I'm trying to understand how the margin interest charge is calculated when you borrow money from a broker like Fidelity to buy stocks for  intraday trades. If the rate is 8% then is the daily charge should be 8% / 365 or 0.0219% of how much you borrowed?  Or if you buy and then sell the stock on the same day  then the   broker does not charge you any interest?

Is it possible for lions to survive in real life on bugs The song Hakuna Matata from The Lion King is all about eating bugs when you are a lion. I was wondering if this is actually a real life fact that lions can survive on bugs or did the Lion King makers just make this fact up to make kids less scared of bugs?

Is "Can you come to the game on Saturday?" a question or a request? Someone asks me "Can you come to the game on Saturday?"  I replied yes but thinking they are asking me a question and not actually tell me to come.  The asker assumed that I would come and got annoyed when I didn't show up.  Who is at fault?

How to tackle the bibliographic work as an entering PhD student? I'll be starting my PhD in the next fall. I already looked over the internet for advice for a beginner, even read two books on the subjects. Still, there is one point I haven't seen discussed as I wanted, it's the time and the way the student should be investing in catching up on his field and his specific topic, I'm speaking about the bibliographic part. For sure a student needs a lot of (continuous) input, but at the end he'll be solely judged on his output. From my previous research project, I'm not really confident in my way of balancing between going through articles/textbook material and trying to solve my own problematics. To be honest, it sometimes feels like a sneaky way of procrastinating: I'd tell myself that I'm still not ready to tackle my problem and that I need to make a little "detour" by existing works; and when it's done I don't feel more at ease to answer my questions. Or is it a normal aspect of research?In my specific case, I'll be working on a quite new subject (string theory) when I only had advanced lecture of quantum field theory and general relativity; so I'm thinking about going through the canonical textbook on the subject during the summer, do most of the exercises and derivations in there (which already represents hundreds of hours invested), maybe revising some mathematical tools I need to be really familiar with. Once I'll have a general idea of the topic I'll jump to the main articles in relation to my thesis. I also know that I will be using numerical tools (Monte Carlo methods) and will need to get conformable with that. So far I only have a superficial knowledge and use of the tool.Does it seem like a good use of my time? I already know that time and willpower are limited resources in grad school and I really don't want my desire to do well to burn me out from the beginning.

Why does the minor pentatonic scale sounds "oriental" to me? I've been training my minor pentatonic scale on guitar for a while (mostly playing it in A with the first position) and it always sounded somewhat oriental to me, in the sense of the musical airs you'd find in music to set the plot in Orient, musical clichés. I am not sure to be really clear in trying to share this impression, but I, then, read that in Orient they used to split the octave in 5 tones, and not 7 as we did in Europe, would it be because the pentatonic as only five notes (by definition) that my sub

Looking for advice on my self-taught music education Until a year ago, I had absolutely no music education, and I decided to change that around this period, well more exactly I picked up on (acoustic) guitar as a hobby and from there gained interest in knowing more about music. And so I discovered some theory: scales, chords, keys, harmony, melody and rhythm on websites and in some books. I also followed Wright lectures "Listening to music" http://oyc.yale.edu/ and read the first chapters of his book on this course (or vice-versa). I've gained knowledge but I'm not sure about the next steps, should I try applying it on my guitar ans starting to transcribe/compose? Listen the most to the broadest set of music genres? Start focusing on one? I'm a bit lost in my learning path, and would be glad to hear some suggestions.

How can I increase my focus and pleasure in reading English? After working on my oral skills in English for a couple of years, I know more interested in learning written English, specially by reading. I have been reading a couple of books over the last months (Game of Thrones, the whole Sherlock Holmes, Lord of the Rings, some Stephen King...) and articles (the Guardian, the New York Times, the Atlantic, mostly). But although I've felt some improvements in my understanding, and learned lots of words, I'm still not enjoying reading English as much as I do enjoy reading French (which is my natural language), and I'm not even what you could call a literary (checking my other stackexchange affiliations would prove you that...). When reading English I just follow the plot, but I'm really totally insensitive in the style of writing, in the choice of words, ... I hardly realized that when reading a few pages of French the other day, it's even way easier to focus on what I read when it is French than English.Fellow who learned English as a second (or third, or more...) language, have already felt that? Have you been through that? How long did it take? Or is it just a never ending job in progress but I'll never reach the ease I have with French?

How to improve finger style guitar playing I am a competent, but not amazing, guitar player who is very comfortable with the usual chords as well as basic fingerpicking patterns. I would like to take it to the next level and be able to improvise and play something along the lines of (though not initially as complicated as) this by James Taylor: 
                
             - starting at about 2:40. Another example of something that I would love to do is 
                
            . As opposed to learning a particular song, which is fine, I am more interested in learning general techniques that I can improvise with when I am playing around on the guitar.What resources/tutorials/lessons would you recommend that can help me play interesting things like in these videos? 

What does "her mama leaned hard" in this Emmylou Harris Song mean? I was listening to the song "Red Dirt Girl" by Emmylou Harris, and didn't understand one of the lyrics: "her mama leaned hard." What does this mean?Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hardGot in trouble with a boy from townI did find one definition from this blog, but it doesn't seem to be what I am looking for: "To lean hard you must get under God’s feet and submit to His plans and purposes, even if you do not see them fully or understand them at all. Leaning means shifting all the weight of the burden from your shoulders to His."

How to gracefully walk away from coauthored paper I am working on a coauthored paper which I would like to step away from. How can I do so very tactfully and gracefully? I want to step away because I don't quite agree with the direction the paper is taking in terms of analysis; the publication prospects are not terrific; and, frankly, I am not sure if I fully believe the results (our setting is not very "clean," meaning that there are several alternative explanations). I don't necessarily want to say all of these things to them.Another detail is that the coauthors are two people at my current institution. I am going to be transitioning to another institution (in another state) in the next few months. Note this is not one of my main reasons to walk away, but being away will make it somewhat harder to collaborate. It will also be nice to get this off my plate so I can focus more on other projects.

Fungible Money Question Suppose that there are two people, A and B.  Each has a physical dollar bill.  Each donates the dollar bill to an organization.  The organization buys something for a dollar.First suppose that the organization buys the something with one of the two physical dollar bills.  If A claims that his money bought the item, then he may or may not be correct.  This is analogous for B.  All you would have to do is check the dollar and figure out who it originally came from.However, suppose that the bank deposits the money into an online bank account.  Then the money is truly fungible.  If A claims that the organization bought something with his money, how would we evaluate this claim?  Does it even make any sense for A to make this claim?  What if B also makes the claim?

Data Source for 2012 US Congress and US Senate Elections I need to find a good data source for the 2012 United States Congress and Senate elections.  I have found this: http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2012/federalelections2012.shtml  The problem is that it is in a not-so-user-friendly format in Excel.  And an even harder-to-use format in PDF.I have found the State Legislative returns in a good format at http://www.indstate.edu/polisci/klarnerpolitics.htm.  I would ideally have the same thing as this.Any kind of CSV, Stata, etc. would be fantastic.Any tips on where I should look?

Expand Bass Guitar Playing Beyond Root Notes I am fairly new to the bass guitar and I'm in a band.  So far, I almost always just play the root note of the chord.  I sometimes hold it until a new chord and sometimes repeatedly play this same note.The root notes I commonly play are C, D, B, F#, E, etc.   For example, a song may be D G Bm A. What I am doing is fine, but I feel like it would be great to branch out and play things besides just the root.  How should I go about this?  What are examples?

Punctuation inside of quotation marks with technical phrases If I am not mistaken, one should insert a period, question mark, etc. inside of the quotation mark in quoted speech.  For example,   The man continued, "The sky is purple today."  My question concerns the use of punctuation when the thing within the quotation marks is a specific technical thing.  For example,   The correct computer password is "AbCd!".Should the period be before or after the final quotation mark in the last example?

What Defines a Utah Accent? I have heard a number of people refer to the "Utah accent."  What is it that distinguishes a Utah accent from others?I have noticed that, in some cases, people from Utah omit the 't' from words such as 'Layton' and 'mountain.'  In other cases, it seems like they pronounce 'milk' with an 'e' instead of an 'i.'  'Creek' sounds like 'crick.' 'Mormon' like 'Marmon.' I am not sure if any of these are specific to Utah.Finally, what about differences between regions, for example, what is a Cache Valley accent?

[rank0]:[W709 14:57:57.461780087 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Shall I ask my agency to overturn negative client feedback? I work for a writing agency. A few days ago, a client asked us to do some work for his website. The client said it was 'proofreading'. I did the work, the agency approved it. It was sent to the client for final approval.The client wrote back to say that what he actually wanted was his text rewritten so the site sold better. I wrote back to the agency to say this pretty much constituted a new job. The agency agreed so I got on with the work.I resubmitted and the agency approved it - again! It was sent to the client for final approval. I waited a few days and the client rejected it. He wrote back to say that the work was low quality and he could have done a better job himself. My agency were very nice about it, I got paid regardless, but it left a blemish on my stats, it's the first time a client has rejected a piece of my work.I am considering writing to my agency and asking them to overturn the negative feedback because1 - the client was vague about what they wanted - and in the first place, they described what they wanted incorrectly;2 - it was a new client, so we had no previous examples of what the client liked to work from3 - it's clear that the client had something very specific in mind, but they were not able to articulate their needs or show us the kind of thing they had in mind.I kept to the description as much as I could - short, concise, selling the site, a bit humorous. There was nothing I could do save getting inside the client's head. Because of this one negative piece of feedback I am now nearly halfway down my agency's ladder of writers, whereas before I was at the top.Should I write to my agency about this or just swallow it? I could do the latter, but I still feel an injustice is being done somewhere. 

Article I wrote has been published under another name - should I raise this with the publisher? I do part-time copywriting work and over the weekend I wrote a ~1500 word paid article for an online publication. It was a lot of research and toil, I had half a day to do it and I finally submitted the thing at 2am on Sunday. It was a very tricky piece.Now I notice the article has been published, with some minor edits, but under a different name. The client has used one of their own employees as the author. I wasn't aware that I was ghostwriting. Should I raise this with the publisher? Should credit not be given where it is due - or should I remain quiet unless I irritate them? I'm quite new to this but should they not at least have said it would be credited to someone else?

Should I include the name[s] of copywriting agencies I write for on my CV? I'm a startup copywriter, and some agencies request a CV on application to join. Should I include the name[s] of some of the agencies I already work with and which send me jobs?

Client has asked for a piece to be rewritten after agency acceptance of my submission. How much should I charge? Yesterday I was given a job which was to proofread a website and make any changes "where necessary". That's all the brief said. I did so, amended any typos etc, changed some grammar and spiced it up here and there. I submitted my piece and my agency accepted it, meaning I get paid. Great.I am a freelance copywriter. Today I get a message saying that the client says there was a "misunderstanding". He says he wants the text rewritten in a way that sells the site more, not just changed here and there. Clearly my agency thought I had fulfilled his brief, because they accepted my submission, but he is saying he wants the thing basically rewritten from scratch as I understand it.How much do I charge for this revision? I will be paid X for my original submission. But should I charge X again, because this sounds like a new job, half of X or less? I love my agency and don't want to annoy them, but it seems that the client's original brief was really vague. I am unsure of what to do.

Should one use first or third person terminology when discussing one's character? This is not about viewing the character, but how to refer to them verbally in conversation. On these and other boards I see plenty of people using both first and third person terminology, e.g. "I did this" vs "my character did this"; or "my character prefers magic over weaponry" rather than "I prefer magic over weaponry" in the context of the game. Speaking in the third person makes it seem like the character is an independent entity, which they clearly are not since their existence depends on that of the player.I find this confusing. Sometimes the player will make the character do things the player would not do in real life in such a situation, but then, it is still the player making those choices. My player is female but I am male, I still refer to her as "I" - is this not correct [by "correct" I mean whatever is considered normal practice]?I am tagging this question with Skyrim, because, unlike with, e.g The Witcher, the player creates the character from the ground up [I am sure there are many other games when the player has to do the same but I don't know what they are].

Winstad Manor: Will my firepit go if I change my small house to an entryway? I just bought Hearthfire in Oldrim and was very keen to get going with building Windstad Manor. I should have focused on the main house construction rather than the furnishings and I put a firepit and cooking pot in the small house which will become the entrance.Now I realise that when I extend the house I won't want this firepit there. When I convert this small house to an entryway, will the firepit/cooking pot disappear? I would prefer this. In the future I will just focus on construction of the main areas rather than any interior furnishings.

Can I dimiss or kill my steward but keep my bard? I live in Winstad Manor. I just live with my wife currently. In an earlier save I hired Valdimir as a steward and Sonir as a bard. I liked Sonir [as long as she doesn't sing "The Dragonborn Comes", it's not a good number for her] and want to keep her, but, when I hired Valdimir as a steward beforehand he started wandering in and out of the house all the time, eating bread and sitting in the private bedroom, which is clearly not on.How do I get rid of him and keep Sonir? I take it that the only thing to do, without mods, is to kill him. If I do so, will Sonir stay?

Is it possible to change the music in quest mods to something else? I downloaded a quest mod, The Cathedral on Steam for Oldrim, and it's pretty good but the music isn't. I feel it would benefit much more from an ambient soundtrack. I was wondering if it's possible to add my own music to this particular mod instead of using its own.Important: the music for the main game must be unchanged and should play as normal when outside of the mod area. Thanks for any ideas :)

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Grades vs. projects in job application I am teaching computer science undergraduates, who will most likely go to work in the software industry. They often ask me for career advice and I want to know what advice to give them. Specifically, suppose a student can choose between two elective courses:Course A has a relatively low average grade (60-70/100), but during the homework assignments, the students build an industry-level project.Course B has a relatively high average grade (80-90/100), the homework assignments are simple and not industry-level.On one hand, course A lowers the student's average grade, so there is more chance the student will be filtered out based on a low average, even before the interview.On the other hand, if the student does get to the interview stage, having a strong project to show is a big advantage.I know that each work-place is different, but I would still be happy if there is a general rule-of-thumb to help the student decide: what is more helpful for getting a job in the software industry - a high average grade, or a strong project?

Pandemic - reduced rule-set for beginners I have recently started playing pandemic, and was overwhelmed by the amount of rules.Is there a reduced set of rules, easier to learn and remember but still fun, that can be used by beginners until they get used to the game?EDIT: My goal is not to make the game easier to win - it is to make the game easier to learn how to play. Instead of learning all rules at once, the team can learn the rules one by one. For example, suppose there are 10 rules (just an arbitrary number). Then instead of remembering all these rules at once, we can start with 5 rules, then add a new rule each play, until we remember and play by all rules.

How can I convert a linear narrative into a branching narrative? Suppose I would like to create a text adventure game, but my imagination is not sufficient for creating a whole game. But there are fiction books (in the public domain) that are very imaginative and could potentially make a great game. The main problem is that, a standard fiction book is sequential, while in a game there are many branches. Even if I have, say, only 10 branches, I still have to write 9 of these on my own.Is there a process that can make this easier? A structured procedure by which I can work, that can help me convert a novel to a text adventure, with minimal need to use my "rusty" imagination?I looked around the web and found some links that apparently discuss this topic, but with few details:Five tips for turning a book into an interactive game - mainly discusses what should be in a book in order to be able to make a game out of it, namely: scalability, strong characters, first-person narrative, and genre. But, it does not speak about the conversion process itself.What the heck is interactive fiction? - a subsection titled "Converting Fiction to IF" gives some hints: pick a shorter story, think about the choices your character makes, think how to display text on the page, think outside the page. Again, few details about the process itself are given.EDIT: thanks a lot to all the repliers for the wonderful ideas and the warm welcome!

Ice-cream-on-a-stick in refrigerator temperature In the summer, I used to make ice-cream-on-a-stick in various flavors. Some examples:Chocolate flavor: melted cocoa + honey + coconut oil + almond butter.Banana flavor: bananas + peanut butter + cinnamon + soy milk.I just mixed them, put in a mould, put a wooden stick in each hole, and put in the freezer. Then, I could grab one in the morning and eat on the way to work as a breakfast.Now, winter is coming and it is unpleasant to eat at freezer temperature, so I wonder if I can achieve the same effect in refrigerator temperature: is there an ingredient I can add to the mixture, that will make it freeze, and stick to the stick, in the refrigerator?

How to find a employer that allows staff to publish academic papers As a Ph.D. candidate, one of the things that I am looking for, when looking for a job, is the opportunity to continue publishing academic papers related to work. I know that there are some companies whose workers publish academic papers, such as: Google, Microsoft, IBM and Yahoo. I am wondering whether there is some website that compares companies according to how academic they are. E.g, counts the number of publications per worker in each company, etc. Is there any website that publishes such information?

Can I become flexible enough to touch the ground? I am 175 cm. high, 45 years old. When I stand with my legs straight and bow down, my palms are about 70 cm above the ground. I have done this daily for several weeks, hoping that I will improve in time, but the distance to the ground does not seem to shorten.Is there any exercise I can do, that will make me flexible enough so that I can touch the ground?

How can I prevent animals from marking my camp as their territory? Often, when I leave my tent during the day, cats and other animals come and pee in the corners and on the carpet. They probably do this to mark it as their territory. They don't come at night when I sleep inside. Besides building a fence around my tent, which is expensive and time-consuming, is there other way to convince animals that they shouldn't come?

The sheep and the wolves When I was a child, I was playing a game such as the following:The game is played on a standard chessboard, but only on the black squares.There are two players: the white player has a single white pawn which is the "sheep"; the black player has four pawns which are the "wolves".The players start at opposite sides of the board, and make a single diagonal step each turn.The goal of the wolves is to capture the sheep - surround it such that it cannot move.The goal of the sheep is to escape the wolves and get to the opposite side of the board.Recently I tried playing it again, but found out that I do not remember the exact rules. Specifically:* Is the sheep allowed to go backward, or only forward?* Are the wolves allowed to go backward, or only forward?We tried to play this game with all four combinations. In each combination, the game turned out to be too easy for one side and too difficult for the other side.What are the rules that make this game sufficiently challenging for both sides?

# Past post questions and detailed descriptions of these questions:
Tofu as a growing medium? I just had a strange idea of no actual significance, but I was just staring at a block of tofu and wondered if you could plant things in it. Has anyone tried this? How does/would tofu fair as a growing medium. How would plants grow differently in hard, medium, and soft tofu?

What is the functional role of the subtonic chord? In this chartthe subtonic major chord can come before the mediant and submedian chords. Does this imply that it has a tonic functionality? If so that seems counter-intuitive; it seems to share more in common with the dominant chord than the tonic. On the other hand, if it's a dominant function, why would you have a i-VII-III... progression? Wouldn't it make more sense for the VII to fall later, towards the end of the phrase.(Also I'm assuming that the VII actually refers to the bVII chord, but if I'm wrong please correct me on that)

How do I know where to place holes on an instrument? I've been trying to build a double reeded instrument out of plastic straws. I've run into a problem though, when I place fingering holes, the instrument doesn't seem to follow the $$f=/frac{nv}{4L}$$ formula. Is there a formula that would allow me to calculate where along the instrument I should place the holes?

Dill, cilantro, and fennel cross pollinating I've read several conflicting pieces of information on the growing of dill, cilantro, and fennel near one another. I've read that fennel and dill will grow well together and make good companion plants, however I've also read that they will cross pollinate to make a foul-smelling hybrid. I've read that dill and cilantro will cross pollinate to create a rather disgusting culinary useless hybrid, but I've also read that they can be beneficial to one another's growth. I have not, however, read anything on cilantro and fennel growing together. How do these three plants fare when grown with one another, and is there any risk of cross pollination or hybridization?To cut costs I am planning on using the seeds again. I (personally) don't particularly care about hybrids or GMOs, I just want to be able to use the plants as herbs. However, should the hybrids not be culinarily useful, I would begin to care.

How to put up my string items without tangling When I put up Christmas lights onto my house, I must first untangle them. Is there any way when I put them (or any similar item) away for them not to become tangle and knotted without buying something specifically for that purpose.

Is maral root useful as a companion plant? I was looking at rarer plants to grow for natural pesticide purposes and I was wondering how maral root fares. What conditions does this plant need to grow? At what temperature, water amounts, soil conditions, etc. can this plant grow in, is it hardy or highly sensitive? Also, will it interfere with other plants?

Use of diminished—major seventh chords Could someone please describe how and when a diminished-major chord would be used. How would one lead up to it, resolve it, and are there any rules about inversions with it? An explained example usage in common-practice music would be helpful.

On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
