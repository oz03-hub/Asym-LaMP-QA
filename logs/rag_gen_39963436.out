To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())

To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

{  "personalized_answer": "Based on your past interest in woodworking and your detailed questions about tools and measurements, it seems you are quite particular about precision. When calculating trowel size, it's important to consider the specific task you'll be performing. For fine woodworking tasks like jointing or planing, a smaller trowel (e.g., 1/4" or 1/2") might be more suitable for achieving a smooth finish. However, for heavier tasks like levelling or spreading mortar, a larger trowel (e.g., 1/2" to 1") would be more appropriate. Given your focus on accuracy and the quality of your work, I recommend choosing a trowel size that matches the level of detail required for your project. If you're unsure, a 3/4" trowel is a versatile choice that can handle most tasks with precision and ease."}

{  "personalized_answer": "Based on your previous questions and the detailed descriptions, it seems like you are familiar with HVAC systems and are trying to troubleshoot various issues. The problem with the HVAC duct not connecting to the return likely stems from a mismatch in the duct sizes or improper installation. Since you mentioned a 4" fan and a 3" duct, this could be the root cause. A common solution is to use a reducer fitting to connect the 4" duct to the 3" return. Additionally, ensure that the ductwork is properly sealed and supported to avoid any leaks or air flow issues. If the problem persists, it might be helpful to consult a professional HVAC technician to inspect the system and make any necessary adjustments."}

{  "personalized_answer": "It sounds like you're dealing with a challenging situation where some of your teammates are intentionally trying to hinder your progress and success. This behavior can be particularly frustrating, especially when you're putting in extra effort to excel. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:\n\n1. **Document Specific Incidents:** Keep a record of instances where teammates are intentionally holding you back. Note the date, time, what was said or done, and any witnesses. This documentation can be crucial if you decide to escalate the issue.\n\n2. **Seek Support from Your Manager:** Schedule a meeting with your manager to discuss your concerns. Be specific about the behaviors you're observing and provide examples. Emphasize that you're committed to your role and that these behaviors are affecting your performance and morale.\n\n3. **Communicate Your Feelings:** Have an open and honest conversation with the individuals involved. Express how their actions make you feel and explain that you're working hard and contributing positively to the team. Use "I" statements to avoid sounding accusatory, e.g., 'I feel that my contributions are being undervalued when...'\n\n4. **Set Clear Expectations:** Work with your manager to set clear, measurable goals and expectations for your role. This can help provide a framework for your contributions and make it easier to demonstrate your value to the team.\n\n5. **Focus on Your Strengths:** Continue to focus on your strengths and the positive impact you're making. Highlight your achievements and the value you bring to the team. This can help counteract negative behaviors and build your confidence.\n\n6. **Seek Mentorship:** Consider seeking mentorship from a trusted colleague or a senior member of the team who can provide guidance and support. They might also be able to offer insights into how to navigate these challenges more effectively.\n\n7. **Consider the Company Culture:** Reflect on the overall culture of the company and the team. If the behavior persists and is widespread, it might be worth considering whether the company culture is supportive and inclusive. You might need to weigh the long-term benefits of staying versus finding a more positive work environment.\n\nRemember, it's important to handle these situations with professionalism and to prioritize your well-being. If the behavior continues to affect you negatively, don't hesitate to seek further support from HR or other resources within the company."}

The issue with the HVAC duct not connecting to the return likely stems from a mismatch in the duct sizes or improper installation. Given that you've dealt with similar issues in the past, such as the 4" fan and 3" duct, it's possible that the ducting for the return is either too small or not properly sized to accommodate the airflow. I recommend checking the duct dimensions and ensuring they match the requirements of your HVAC system. If the ducts are correctly sized, you might need to inspect the connections for any obstructions or misalignments. If the problem persists, consulting a professional HVAC technician would be the best course of action to ensure proper installation and airflow."}

INFO 07-15 12:35:55 model_runner.py:1415] Capturing cudagraphs for decoding. This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.
