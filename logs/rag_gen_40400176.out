If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

INFO 07-29 23:41:56 model_runner.py:1415] Capturing cudagraphs for decoding. This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

{  "personalized_answer": "It sounds like you're dealing with a challenging situation where a coworker, let's call them 'CoworkerX', is potentially damaging your reputation. Given the history of issues with another manager, Dick, it's understandable that you're concerned. Here are some steps you can take to address the situation without risking your career or relationships at work:\n\n1. **Document Specific Incidents**: Keep a detailed record of any instances where CoworkerX has tarnished your reputation. Note the date, time, what was said or done, and any witnesses. This documentation can be crucial if you decide to escalate the issue.\n\n2. **Talk to CoworkerX Directly**: Consider having a private conversation with CoworkerX to address the behavior. Be specific about the incidents and how they have affected you. Use "I" statements to express your feelings, such as 'I feel uncomfortable when...'. This approach can sometimes resolve the issue without involving higher management.\n\n3. **Seek Support from Trusted Colleagues**: If CoworkerX is a significant part of your team, it might be helpful to discuss the situation with other trusted colleagues. They might provide additional insights or support.\n\n4. **Report to HR Anonymously**: If the behavior continues and you feel it's impacting your work environment, consider submitting an anonymous report to HR. Many companies have anonymous reporting systems in place to address such issues. This can help HR understand the situation without directly implicating you.\n\n5. **Consider a Formal Complaint**: If the behavior is severe and continues despite your efforts, you might need to file a formal complaint. Ensure you have all the documentation ready and follow the company's procedures for reporting such issues.\n\n6. **Focus on Your Work**: Continue to focus on your work and maintain a professional demeanor. This can help you stay on track and minimize the impact of any negative behavior from CoworkerX.\n\nRemember, it's important to handle these situations carefully to protect your career and maintain a positive work environment."}

If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

{  "personalized_answer": "Your question touches on a profound theological issue that has puzzled many throughout history. The concept of divine sovereignty and human responsibility is indeed complex. In the Bible, passages like Romans 9:19-21 suggest that God's decisions are beyond human comprehension and control: 'You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who resists his will?" But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?" Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?' This doesn't mean we are not responsible; rather, it highlights the depth of God's wisdom and the limits of our understanding. Just as David, despite his flaws, was chosen by God, we too are called to live in faith and obedience, trusting in God's plan even when we don't fully understand it. This perspective aligns with the idea that while we may not control every outcome, we are responsible for our choices and actions, which reflect our relationship with God."}

[rank0]:[W729 23:53:03.942084053 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
