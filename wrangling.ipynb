I was trying to pass the 10th level of the Sharpshooter challenge, which is to disarm 6 opponents without changing weapons or reloading.  This could be a bit tricky, except I noticed when I was using the deadeye mode and taking a shot, it didn't lower my ammo count.  I could (and did) take about 10 shots from my 6 shot revolver, one deadeye run at a time, and I still had all my bullets.  Made the challenge pretty easy, once I realized it.  I assume this is a bug...has anyone else encountered this? \"},\n",

However, while I\\'d like to keep the balance and toughness that made this first entry so memorable, I\\'d be running them through in 4e.The first challenge is a more mechanical one...trying to make traps and monsters (what few there are) of approximately the same difficulty.  The question: Is there any system for upgrading monsters and/or traps from AD&D to 4e that people have tried?The second challenge is a bit different...it\\'s more of a gestalt type thing.  Characters in 4e can more easily rest and recuperate, and HP loss is a minor temporary inconvienence rather than a major obstacle like in AD&D.  In short, I\\'m wondering if ToH wouldn\\'t translate well because the characters won\\'t be \"worn down\" enough by the various individual encounters.  The question: Is this an exercise in futility, or can I perform this kind of transition?(Of course, there will have to be a lot of experimentation and such in any case, and the details are well beyond this question, but it would be interesting to know if there are obvious answers to these things.)EDIT: I do own the new ToH hardcover for 4e...but that\\'s not what I\\'m looking for.  The new book is a sort of sequel to the original adventure (or, more precisely, a sequel to \"Return to the Tomb of Horrors\", which was the first sequel).  '},\n",

I have this childhood memory of a fairly cheesy SF movie where a person comes into contact with some kind of crystal, and it goes into his arm near the wrist.

Warning: I'm trying to obfuscate much of this question, and hiding the key elements in spoiler blocks..but some spoilers will probably be inevitable.At the ending of the book Tau Zero the ending seems odd:   the spaceship, travelling at close to the speed of light, is able to have eons pass by in instants, which allows it to travel far, far into our future.  It eventually ends up circling around the eventually collapsing universe, and is able to watch as the universe is reborn in a new big bang.Now, I'm not asking whether the big-crunch theory is out of date, whether the universe is slated to eventually collapse, or about the relative (no pun intended) likelyhood of the creation of a spaceship that can travel near the speed of light.  He makes these assumptions/assertions, backs them up as he sees fit, and moves on.But I was under the understanding that the matter that takes up space in our universe is inately connected with the space of the universe...that during a big-crunch type event, it would not just be the matter within the universe collapsing, but space itself collapsing to a singularity...which would leave the ending not making any sense.  Yet, with the amount of effort he puts into explaining the effects of time dialation and the irrationality of the notion of simultaneity at near-light speeds, it seems odd that something like this would be left hanging.  Is there a solution?\"},\n",

Something confuses the heck out of me in regards to TV broadcasting of (American) Football.I used to live in Seattle.  On Sunday, there were the early games, and the later games.  One was selected to be televised at 1:00 (EST), and one at 4:00 (EST), regardless of which time slot the local team (Seahawks) were playing in.  Easy enough.I now live in New York.  There are still early and late games, of course, at the same times.  There are two local teams (Giants/Jets).  But often if neither of those teams is playing in the later time slot, no game will be shown.  Why?Now, the first impression I had was that this was just a remarkably poor programming decision made by TV execs...but I once heard the announcers at the end of the early game say something like:  A: And coming up next, you'll be seeing one of these three games...     B: Unless you're in New York, of course.     A: Of course.Wha?It sounded slightly sarcastic, like they understood that the policy was strange, but expected.
